       "1. **Ticket Count Discrepancy:**  \n",
       "   The difference between the \"ALL tickets\" list and the Analytics report is expected because Analytics does not include tickets marked as Deleted, Spam, or merged tickets. Please review if such tickets are present in your \"ALL tickets\" list, as this might explain the variation.  \n",
       "   **SM:** I identified that the tickets view week start is Monday vs Analytics week start is Sunday (Analytics export file attached).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **\"Waiting Since\" Column Blank:**  \n",
       "   Could you please provide screenshots of what you are referring to? This will help us better understand the issue and investigate further. Additionally, if you could share more details about the customizations you’ve made to the list view, that would be helpful.  \n",
       "   **SM:** Waiting Since appears to be updating if the ticket got Re-opened. What we are looking for is to have a field that displays the time since last update whether the last response was by agent or customer. The below screenshot shows that Waiting since is empty for the tickets that don't have a customer reply as the last interaction.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Log Time Projects Order:**  \n",
       "   Could you also provide screenshots of what you are referring to for the Log Time project order? This will help us ensure we're on the same page regarding the issue.  \n",
       "   **SM:** The Log time connected to the Harvest timesheet is not sorting the projects alphabetically but based on the newest projects/Client created in Harvest. Can we adjust to always be sorted alphabetically?\n",

I have filters applied not to include closed ticket but the data still includes closed tickets 07:02 PM, 14th Jan Freddy Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue with filters in analytics not excluding closed tickets: 1. Review Your Report Setup: - Ensure the widget settings have the correct filters. - Check if there are report-wide filters in place, as well as widget or page-level filters that could be affecting the data. 2. Validate the Data and Filters: - Make sure you have applied the filter correctly at the widget level by dragging and dropping the widget and entering the necessary filter criteria. 3. Check Historical Data: - If the data involves historical metrics, it may be counting all changes made to tickets, not just their current status. 4. Check for Data Period Conflicts: - Ensure that the page filter and widget filter align. Verify if the date range and dimensions properly reflect the needed data. 5. Analyze Unexpected Results: - If unexpected tickets, like closed ones, are showing up in analytics, review a few sample tickets using the \"Show Activities\" feature to trace their actions and understand why they might appear in the data despite applying filters. Following these steps should help troubleshoot and correct inaccuracies in your analytics data. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Freshdesk support for further assistance with your findings.

Validate the Data and Filters: - Make sure you have applied the filter correctly at the widget level by dragging and dropping the widget and entering the necessary filter criteria. 3. Check Historical Data: - If the data involves historical metrics, it may be counting all changes made to tickets, not just their current status. 4. Check for Data Period Conflicts: - Ensure that the page filter and widget filter align. Verify if the date range and dimensions properly reflect the needed data. 5. Analyze Unexpected Results: - If unexpected tickets, like closed ones, are showing up in analytics, review a few sample tickets using the \"Show Activities\" feature to trace their actions and understand why they might appear in the data despite applying filters. Following these steps should help troubleshoot and correct inaccuracies in your analytics data. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Freshdesk support for further assistance with your findings.

I'm here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have. To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 04:02 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel I need to chat with support immediately 04:03 PM, 16th Jan Freddy I'd love to help you with that. Can you please provide more details about your concern? That way, I can assist you better or transfer you to a support agent if needed. 04:03 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Freshdesk keeps sending the same e-mail in a loop since hours to one customer 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Freddy I'm here to help! Could you please provide more details about the issue? Specifically: 1. Is the email being triggered by a specific automation or rule in Freshdesk? 2. Have there been any recent changes to your email configurations or automations? This will help me narrow down the issue and provide a more accurate solution. 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 1. No 2. No 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Freddy Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your description, it sounds like there may be a bug or a configuration issue causing the email to loop. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try: 1. Check for duplicate automations or rules: Although you mentioned there were no changes, ensure there's no overlapping rule causing the duplication. 2. Review email logs: Check email logs within Freshdesk to identify the initiation point and frequency of the email being sent. 3. Disable and Re-enable Outgoing Emails: Temporarily disable the outgoing email configurations and then re-enable them to see if it stops the loop. 4. Inspect Email Template: Make sure the email template being used is not corrupted or has embedded links causing the loop. If the issue persists after these steps, it may require further investigation by our support team. Would you like me to transfer you to a support agent to assist you with resolving this issue? 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel No please connect me to a human agent 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Freddy Sure, let me put you in touch with one of our agents. 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Hi there, Constantin. This is Siddharth from the Freshdesk team. How are you doing today? 04:05 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Could you elaborate on the issue a bit more with the screenshot to the ticket and the looping that is happening, Constantin? 04:06 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Hello. We have an urgent problem - this already happend twice with freshdesk in the last year, but we also with support couldn't identify the reason. However, please look that you stop the message loop- Freshdesk keeps sending the same message again and again since yesterday: Ticket 36715 04:07 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:08 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Which exact message, Constantin? Could you share the screenshots of the duplicates as well? 04:08 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Look we only see the duplicates since we get via the BCC the duplicates sent 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel I cannot see it in freshdesk browser! 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel But it is being sent by freshdesk 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Could you share the Email header file of two emails from the mailbox so that I could back trace this from the logs? And the email address getting the duplicate emails is office@poolwonder.com am I right here? 04:11 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Re: Problème Nouveau message via le formulaire de contact 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Re: Problème Nouveau message via le formulaire de contact 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:13 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel The bcc is office@poolwonder.com but the original adress is steve@beautyfulljeanne.com 04:13 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel We just noted that the e-mail adress of the customer is incorrect: steve@beautyfulljeanne.com , however is this freshdesk behaviour to try to resend again and again if mail is incorrect? therefore we get the bcc? 04:17 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Looks like there were multiple retries for the email, Constantin. Is there a specific reason why the Bcc is there, Constantin? You can remove the automatic Bcc if this is added by mistake, by navigating to Admin > Channel > email > Advanced email settings > Edit automatic BCC 04:18 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Yes, you are right. We have a retry policy on our end if the email sent is not delivered. 04:18 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Yes the bcc is in place so we actually know about problems like this. because otherwise i guess we would not have known that there is a problem with delivering the mail...? 04:19 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Is there a way to edit this retry policy and limit to only 3 retries for example and get notified if all 3 retries were not successful? 04:20 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth I'm afraid that the retry policy is something that is set on a product level, Constantin, and sincere apologies on the delay in response here. 04:23 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth The retries cannot be limited on an account level, so the retries would happen and eventually, we would suppress the user because of too many bounces. 04:24 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth This is the functionality of the emails sent from Freshdesk as of now. 04:25 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel and if no cc in place how would we find out about the problem then? 04:25 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth This issue is something that we have discussed internally, Constantin. We do have an \"Undelivered\" tag that we add from our end to the product's ticket page when the email is not delivered. But, this is something that is limited to the \"Freshdesk mail servers\" as of now and due to the complexities of the custom mailbox and it's attribute returns from the mailbox. 04:29 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth As of now, your account uses the Custom mailbox configuration, so the Undelivered tag will not be added, and we do have a feature request raised with our product team for the same and we are discussing this, Constantin. The issue where it becomes complex for us is the return of attributes. 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel and what do you mean by suppressing the user? Do you mean my account or the e-mail from my customer? 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth The email address of the recipient. 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel okay thank you for clarification ! 04:31 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth So say, there is a false email address whose email address is not reachable 04:31 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth We would attempt the email delivery for the address and after multiple bounces and email validation, we would suppress the user as this uses up the mailserver resources. 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth And after 7 days, the user is unsuppressed. 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel so you suppress the e-mail address of the recipient 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel not my user account of freshdesk 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth yes, not the user account on Freshdesk. It is strictly done for the end user address. 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Okay thank you !

This app allows you to prevent agents from editing the groups while keeping the other required fields visible and functional.

The developers are aware of this bug and are working on a fix.

This will help me assist you better. For instance, is it a chatbot on a specific platform or part of a particular software or service? 03:15 PM, 17th Jan BoomTech Support Support I mena new AI Agent 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Apologies! I am trained to answer in English, Hindi, Spanish, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Portuguese (BR), Swedish, German and French. 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Yes, it is possible to ask users for their email before starting a conversation with an AI agent and make it required. You can configure your bot conversation settings to include mandatory questions such as capturing the user's email. Here are the steps to do that: 1. Set Up Bot Questions: - Go to Admin > Bots and use the Enabled/Disabled toggle to turn on the bot interaction. - Edit the default questions or add custom questions to capture user information before proceeding with the conversation. By default, the bot questions include capturing the Email, Name, and Phone number. You can configure these questions to validate responses to ensure they meet required formats (e.g., a valid email format). 2. Customization: - You can add custom questions by clicking on Add Custom Question and entering the required details such as the label, text, and response type. You can also specify validation messages if the user provides an invalid response. 3. Validation: - Configure negative validation responses for the questions. For example, if the user's reply to the Email ID question is invalid, you can prompt them with a message like \"Oops..Please enter a valid email ID\". 4. Workflow Configuration: - The Hallway Lead Bot allows you to collect user information such as name, email, and phone, validate responses with follow-up questions, and set appropriate messages if responses are invalid. By ensuring these configurations, the bot will prompt and validate the required user information, like an email ID, before proceeding with any conversation. For more information and detailed steps, you can refer to sources about setting up and customizing bot interactions and workflows.

We use Freshdesk as our ticketing system, and I wanted to reach out regarding user permissions. Would it be possible to grant external users the ability to \"edit and search\" the tickets they have submitted? This feature would greatly enhance their workflow and productivity. Since I'm part of the IT team, I receive incoming tickets, and I’ve noticed a recurring issue. For example, if our QC team submits a ticket for a defective laptop that needs replacement, but later realizes they forgot to mention a cracked screen, they have no option to update the existing ticket. Instead, they create a \"new ticket\", which can lead to clutter and inefficiencies. Non Freshdesk Agent users (For Ex:, HR department, QC, etc ) submit dozens of tickets daily, or even hundreds per month, and the inability to modify their submissions often leads to unnecessary duplicate tickets. Since they are not Freshdesk Agents, they currently lack permissions to \"edit and search\" their own tickets. Would you be able to suggest the best approach to allow Non-Agents (external users) to edit and search their previously submitted tickets without granting them full Agent permissions? Ideally, we’d like them to be able to update their own tickets without gaining broader system access. I’d appreciate any insights or recommendations you might have on this.

         "**Subject:** Ticketing Queries\n\n**Description:**\n\nHi Swathi,\n\nApologies for the delays, I was out sick and just returned. Let me put together the points for this ticket:\n\n1. **Ticket Count Discrepancy:**  \n   The difference between the \"ALL tickets\" list and the Analytics report is expected because Analytics does not include tickets marked as Deleted, Spam, or merged tickets. Please review if such tickets are present in your \"ALL tickets\" list, as this might explain the variation.  \n   **SM:** I identified that the tickets view week start is Monday vs Analytics week start is Sunday (Analytics export file attached).\n\n2. **\"Waiting Since\" Column Blank:**  \n   Could you please provide screenshots of what you are referring to? This will help us better understand the issue and investigate further. Additionally, if you could share more details about the customizations you’ve made to the list view, that would be helpful.  \n   **SM:** Waiting Since appears to be updating if the ticket got Re-opened. What we are looking for is to have a field that displays the time since last update whether the last response was by agent or customer. The below screenshot shows that Waiting since is empty for the tickets that don't have a customer reply as the last interaction.\n\n3. **Log Time Projects Order:**  \n   Could you also provide screenshots of what you are referring to for the Log Time project order? This will help us ensure we're on the same page regarding the issue.  \n   **SM:** The Log time connected to the Harvest timesheet is not sorting the projects alphabetically but based on the newest projects/Client created in Harvest. Can we adjust to always be sorted alphabetically?\n\nRegards,  \nSherif Mikhail  \nProfessional Services Manager  \nA: 2211 Michelson Drive, Suite 320, Irvine CA, 92612  \nO: 800-282-8105  \nM: 626-373-3683  \nW: www.contivio.com"

I have filters applied not to include closed ticket but the data still includes closed tickets 07:02 PM, 14th Jan Freddy Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue with filters in analytics not excluding closed tickets: 1. Review Your Report Setup: - Ensure the widget settings have the correct filters. - Check if there are report-wide filters in place, as well as widget or page-level filters that could be affecting the data. 2. Validate the Data and Filters: - Make sure you have applied the filter correctly at the widget level by dragging and dropping the widget and entering the necessary filter criteria. 3. Check Historical Data: - If the data involves historical metrics, it may be counting all changes made to tickets, not just their current status. 4. Check for Data Period Conflicts: - Ensure that the page filter and widget filter align. Verify if the date range and dimensions properly reflect the needed data. 5. Analyze Unexpected Results: - If unexpected tickets, like closed ones, are showing up in analytics, review a few sample tickets using the \"Show Activities\" feature to trace their actions and understand why they might appear in the data despite applying filters. Following these steps should help troubleshoot and correct inaccuracies in your analytics data. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Freshdesk support for further assistance with your findings.

If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Freshdesk support for further assistance with your findings.

         "**Subject:** Conversation with Cheryll Abisado\n\n**Description:**\n\n**Freddy:**  \nHi Cheryll Abisado! I'm Freddy, your friendly AI agent! 😊 I'm here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have. To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! 🤝  \n*07:00 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nI need an agent.  \n*07:00 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Freddy:**  \nI'd love to help you with that. Can you please provide more details about your concern so I can assist you better?  \n*07:00 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nAnalytics data is not accurate.  \n*07:01 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Freddy:**  \nThank you for sharing that. I need to understand more to help you accurately. Could you please provide more details on what specific data or metrics you are finding inaccurate in your analytics? Are you referring to Freshdesk or Freshcaller analytics?  \n*07:01 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nI'm creating analytics for tickets. I have filters applied not to include closed tickets, but the data still includes closed tickets.  \n*07:02 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Freddy:**  \nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue with filters in analytics not excluding closed tickets:\n\n1. **Review Your Report Setup:**  \n   - Ensure the widget settings have the correct filters.  \n   - Check if there are report-wide filters in place, as well as widget or page-level filters that could be affecting the data.\n\n2. **Validate the Data and Filters:**  \n   - Make sure you have applied the filter correctly at the widget level by dragging and dropping the widget and entering the necessary filter criteria.\n\n3. **Check Historical Data:**  \n   - If the data involves historical metrics, it may be counting all changes made to tickets, not just their current status.\n\n4. **Check for Data Period Conflicts:**  \n   - Ensure that the page filter and widget filter align. Verify if the date range and dimensions properly reflect the needed data.\n\n5. **Analyze Unexpected Results:**  \n   - If unexpected tickets, like closed ones, are showing up in analytics, review a few sample tickets using the \"Show Activities\" feature to trace their actions and understand why they might appear in the data despite applying filters.\n\nFollowing these steps should help troubleshoot and correct inaccuracies in your analytics data. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Freshdesk support for further assistance with your findings.  \nRead More: Applying filters at a widget level in Analytics  \n*07:02 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Freddy:**  \nWas I helpful?

How can I assist you today? 08:56 AM, 16th Jan Tabarak Mohammed setup custom priority 08:57 AM, 16th Jan Freddy To set up custom priority in Freshservice, you can utilize the Priority Matrix feature which allows you to automatically set the priority of tickets based on the urgency and impact fields. Here’s how you can do it: 1. Navigate to Admin > Service Management > Helpdesk Settings > Priority Matrix. 2. Toggle the Enable Priority Matrix switch to ON on the Priority Matrix page. 3. Set the values for the Urgency and Impact fields according to your organization's requirements, defining priority levels from Low to Urgent. 4. Click Save to save your changes. From now on, when a ticket is created or updated, Freshservice will automatically set the ticket's priority based on the values selected for Urgency and Impact. You can also configure the priority matrix to allow requesters to set the Urgency and Impact values while submitting the ticket. To do this: 1.

         "Freddy Hi Constantin Fränkel! I'm Freddy, your friendly AI agent! ? I'm here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have. To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 04:02 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel I need to chat with support immediately 04:03 PM, 16th Jan Freddy I'd love to help you with that. Can you please provide more details about your concern? That way, I can assist you better or transfer you to a support agent if needed. 04:03 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Freshdesk keeps sending the same e-mail in a loop since hours to one customer 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Freddy I'm here to help! Could you please provide more details about the issue? Specifically: 1. Is the email being triggered by a specific automation or rule in Freshdesk? 2. Have there been any recent changes to your email configurations or automations? This will help me narrow down the issue and provide a more accurate solution. 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 1. No 2. No 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Freddy Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your description, it sounds like there may be a bug or a configuration issue causing the email to loop. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try: 1. Check for duplicate automations or rules: Although you mentioned there were no changes, ensure there's no overlapping rule causing the duplication. 2. Review email logs: Check email logs within Freshdesk to identify the initiation point and frequency of the email being sent. 3. Disable and Re-enable Outgoing Emails: Temporarily disable the outgoing email configurations and then re-enable them to see if it stops the loop. 4. Inspect Email Template: Make sure the email template being used is not corrupted or has embedded links causing the loop. If the issue persists after these steps, it may require further investigation by our support team. Would you like me to transfer you to a support agent to assist you with resolving this issue? 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel No please connect me to a human agent 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Freddy Sure, let me put you in touch with one of our agents. 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Hi there, Constantin. This is Siddharth from the Freshdesk team. How are you doing today? 04:05 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Could you elaborate on the issue a bit more with the screenshot to the ticket and the looping that is happening, Constantin? 04:06 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Hello. We have an urgent problem - this already happend twice with freshdesk in the last year, but we also with support couldn't identify the reason. However, please look that you stop the message loop- Freshdesk keeps sending the same message again and again since yesterday: Ticket 36715 04:07 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:08 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Which exact message, Constantin? Could you share the screenshots of the duplicates as well? 04:08 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Look we only see the duplicates since we get via the BCC the duplicates sent 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel I cannot see it in freshdesk browser! 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel But it is being sent by freshdesk 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Could you share the Email header file of two emails from the mailbox so that I could back trace this from the logs? And the email address getting the duplicate emails is office@poolwonder.com am I right here? 04:11 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Re: Problème Nouveau message via le formulaire de contact 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Re: Problème Nouveau message via le formulaire de contact 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:13 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel The bcc is office@poolwonder.com but the original adress is steve@beautyfulljeanne.com 04:13 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel We just noted that the e-mail adress of the customer is incorrect: steve@beautyfulljeanne.com , however is this freshdesk behaviour to try to resend again and again if mail is incorrect? therefore we get the bcc? 04:17 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Looks like there were multiple retries for the email, Constantin. Is there a specific reason why the Bcc is there, Constantin? You can remove the automatic Bcc if this is added by mistake, by navigating to Admin > Channel > email > Advanced email settings > Edit automatic BCC 04:18 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Yes, you are right. We have a retry policy on our end if the email sent is not delivered. 04:18 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Yes the bcc is in place so we actually know about problems like this. because otherwise i guess we would not have known that there is a problem with delivering the mail...? 04:19 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Is there a way to edit this retry policy and limit to only 3 retries for example and get notified if all 3 retries were not successful? 04:20 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth I'm afraid that the retry policy is something that is set on a product level, Constantin, and sincere apologies on the delay in response here. 04:23 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth The retries cannot be limited on an account level, so the retries would happen and eventually, we would suppress the user because of too many bounces. 04:24 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth This is the functionality of the emails sent from Freshdesk as of now. 04:25 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel and if no cc in place how would we find out about the problem then? 04:25 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth This issue is something that we have discussed internally, Constantin. We do have an \"Undelivered\" tag that we add from our end to the product's ticket page when the email is not delivered. But, this is something that is limited to the \"Freshdesk mail servers\" as of now and due to the complexities of the custom mailbox and it's attribute returns from the mailbox. 04:29 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth As of now, your account uses the Custom mailbox configuration, so the Undelivered tag will not be added, and we do have a feature request raised with our product team for the same and we are discussing this, Constantin. The issue where it becomes complex for us is the return of attributes. 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel and what do you mean by suppressing the user? Do you mean my account or the e-mail from my customer? 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth The email address of the recipient. 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel okay thank you for clarification ! 04:31 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth So say, there is a false email address whose email address is not reachable 04:31 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth We would attempt the email delivery for the address and after multiple bounces and email validation, we would suppress the user as this uses up the mailserver resources. 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth And after 7 days, the user is unsuppressed. 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel so you suppress the e-mail address of the recipient 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel not my user account of freshdesk 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth yes, not the user account on Freshdesk. It is strictly done for the end user address. 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Okay thank you ! I hope that feature request gets pushed because this is a serious bug in my opinion. 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Have a nice day, all the best! 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Noted the same, Constantin. And thank you so much for reaching out to us as well. Do let us know if you require any further help and we shall be happy to help with the same. 04:34 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth I shall mark this chat to the feature request and help you with the updates to the request on the ticket thread. 04:34 PM, 16th Jan Take to Team Inbox",

But, this is something that is limited to the \"Freshdesk mail servers\" as of now and due to the complexities of the custom mailbox and it's attribute returns from the mailbox. 04:29 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth As of now, your account uses the Custom mailbox configuration, so the Undelivered tag will not be added, and we do have a feature request raised with our product team for the same and we are discussing this, Constantin. The issue where it becomes complex for us is the return of attributes. 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel and what do you mean by suppressing the user? Do you mean my account or the e-mail from my customer? 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth The email address of the recipient. 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel okay thank you for clarification ! 04:31 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth So say, there is a false email address whose email address is not reachable 04:31 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth We would attempt the email delivery for the address and after multiple bounces and email validation, we would suppress the user as this uses up the mailserver resources. 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth And after 7 days, the user is unsuppressed. 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel so you suppress the e-mail address of the recipient 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel not my user account of freshdesk 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth yes, not the user account on Freshdesk. It is strictly done for the end user address. 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Okay thank you ! I hope that feature request gets pushed because this is a serious bug in my opinion. 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Have a nice day, all the best! 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Noted the same, Constantin. And thank you so much for reaching out to us as well. Do let us know if you require any further help and we shall be happy to help with the same. 04:34 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth I shall mark this chat to the feature request and help you with the updates to the request on the ticket thread. 04:34 PM, 16th Jan Take to Team Inbox",
         "**Subject:** Conversation with Constantin Fränkel  \n**Description:**  \n\n**Freddy:**  \nHi Constantin Fränkel! I'm Freddy, your friendly AI agent! 😊 I'm here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have. To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! 😊  \n*04:02 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nI need to chat with support immediately.  \n*04:03 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Freddy:**  \nI'd love to help you with that. Can you please provide more details about your concern? That way, I can assist you better or transfer you to a support agent if needed.  \n*04:03 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nFreshdesk keeps sending the same e-mail in a loop since hours to one customer.  \n*04:04 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Freddy:**  \nI'm here to help! Could you please provide more details about the issue? Specifically:  \n1. Is the email being triggered by a specific automation or rule in Freshdesk?  \n2. Have there been any recent changes to your email configurations or automations?  \nThis will help me narrow down the issue and provide a more accurate solution.  \n*04:04 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \n1. No  \n2. No  \n*04:04 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Freddy:**  \nThank you for the clarifications. Based on your description, it sounds like there may be a bug or a configuration issue causing the email to loop. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:  \n1. Check for duplicate automations or rules: Although you mentioned there were no changes, ensure there's no overlapping rule causing the duplication.  \n2. Review email logs: Check email logs within Freshdesk to identify the initiation point and frequency of the email being sent.  \n3. Disable and Re-enable Outgoing Emails: Temporarily disable the outgoing email configurations and then re-enable them to see if it stops the loop.  \n4. Inspect Email Template: Make sure the email template being used is not corrupted or has embedded links causing the loop.  \nIf the issue persists after these steps, it may require further investigation by our support team. Would you like me to transfer you to a support agent to assist you with resolving this issue?  \n*04:04 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nNo, please connect me to a human agent.  \n*04:04 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Freddy:**  \nSure, let me put you in touch with one of our agents.  \n*04:04 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nHi there, Constantin. This is Siddharth from the Freshdesk team. How are you doing today?  \n*04:05 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nCould you elaborate on the issue a bit more with the screenshot to the ticket and the looping that is happening, Constantin?  \n*04:06 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nHello. We have an urgent problem - this already happened twice with Freshdesk in the last year, but we also with support couldn't identify the reason. However, please look that you stop the message loop - Freshdesk keeps sending the same message again and again since yesterday: Ticket 36715.  \n*04:07 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nWhich exact message, Constantin? Could you share the screenshots of the duplicates as well?  \n*04:08 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nLook, we only see the duplicates since we get via the BCC the duplicates sent.  \n*04:09 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nI cannot see it in Freshdesk browser!  \n*04:09 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nBut it is being sent by Freshdesk.  \n*04:09 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nCould you share the Email header file of two emails from the mailbox so that I could backtrace this from the logs? And the email address getting the duplicate emails is office@poolwonder.com, am I right here?  \n*04:11 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nRe: Problème Nouveau message via le formulaire de contact  \n*04:12 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nThe BCC is office@poolwonder.com but the original address is steve@beautyfulljeanne.com.  \n*04:13 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nWe just noted that the email address of the customer is incorrect: steve@beautyfulljeanne.com. However, is this Freshdesk behavior to try to resend again and again if mail is incorrect? Therefore we get the BCC?  \n*04:17 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nLooks like there were multiple retries for the email, Constantin. Is there a specific reason why the BCC is there, Constantin? You can remove the automatic BCC if this is added by mistake, by navigating to Admin > Channel > Email > Advanced Email Settings > Edit Automatic BCC.  \n*04:18 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nYes, you are right. We have a retry policy on our end if the email sent is not delivered.  \n*04:18 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nYes, the BCC is in place so we actually know about problems like this. Because otherwise, I guess we would not have known that there is a problem with delivering the mail...?  \n*04:19 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nIs there a way to edit this retry policy and limit to only 3 retries, for example, and get notified if all 3 retries were not successful?  \n*04:20 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nI'm afraid that the retry policy is something that is set on a product level, Constantin, and sincere apologies for the delay in response here.  \n*04:23 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nThe retries cannot be limited on an account level, so the retries would happen and eventually, we would suppress the user because of too many bounces.  \n*04:24 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nThis is the functionality of the emails sent from Freshdesk as of now.  \n*04:25 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nAnd if no CC in place, how would we find out about the problem then?  \n*04:25 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nThis issue is something that we have discussed internally, Constantin.

To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query.

This app allows you to prevent agents from editing the groups while keeping the other required fields visible and functional.

The column still shows up even when the field is hidden 06:51 PM, 16th Jan Freddy It seems there is currently an identified issue in Freshdesk where attempting to delete the group name in the table view from the tickets list view causes it to reappear. The developers are aware of this bug and are working on a fix. As of now, there isn't a method to specifically remove just the \"Group\" column without also removing the \"Agent\" column due to this bug.

I am trained to answer in English, Hindi, Spanish, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Portuguese (BR), Swedish, German and French. 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Yes, it is possible to ask users for their email before starting a conversation with an AI agent and make it required. You can configure your bot conversation settings to include mandatory questions such as capturing the user's email. Here are the steps to do that: 1. Set Up Bot Questions: - Go to Admin > Bots and use the Enabled/Disabled toggle to turn on the bot interaction. - Edit the default questions or add custom questions to capture user information before proceeding with the conversation. By default, the bot questions include capturing the Email, Name, and Phone number. You can configure these questions to validate responses to ensure they meet required formats (e.g., a valid email format). 2. Customization: - You can add custom questions by clicking on Add Custom Question and entering the required details such as the label, text, and response type. You can also specify validation messages if the user provides an invalid response. 3. Validation: - Configure negative validation responses for the questions. For example, if the user's reply to the Email ID question is invalid, you can prompt them with a message like \"Oops..Please enter a valid email ID\". 4. Workflow Configuration: - The Hallway Lead Bot allows you to collect user information such as name, email, and phone, validate responses with follow-up questions, and set appropriate messages if responses are invalid. By ensuring these configurations, the bot will prompt and validate the required user information, like an email ID, before proceeding with any conversation. For more information and detailed steps, you can refer to sources about setting up and customizing bot interactions and workflows.

For example, if the user's reply to the Email ID question is invalid, you can prompt them with a message like \"Oops..Please enter a valid email ID\".\n\n4. **Workflow Configuration:**\n   - The Hallway Lead Bot allows you to collect user information such as name, email, and phone, validate responses with follow-up questions, and set appropriate messages if responses are invalid.\n\nBy ensuring these configurations, the bot will prompt and validate the required user information, like an email ID, before proceeding with any conversation. For more information and detailed steps, you can refer to sources about setting up and customizing bot interactions and workflows.

The change from \"Open and Pending requests\" to \"All Tickets\" might have been adjusted in the Portal Settings. To revert or adjust the default ticket view for users, you can navigate to the portal settings and configure the sections accordingly. Here’s how: 1.

Manage Sections: - Switch to the \"Manage sections\" tab. - Customize Tickets, Knowledge Base, and Forums as needed. - You can control visibility and default ticket forms. 3. Adjust Ticket Visibility: - Here you can control which ticket statuses are visible by default. - You can allow only logged-in users to view tickets or everyone with the public ticket URL. For further customizing the ticket view options, you can use the options available for viewing tickets on the customer portal by setting up ticket fields and filtering options: - Allow Users to Filter Tickets: - Add ticket fields as filters on the customer portal. Only Dropdowns and Dependent ticket fields can be added as filter options. If you need additional customization or run into issues, you might want to check the detailed portal configuration available in your admin settings.

         "My name is Anderson, and I’m with AirPro Diagnostics in Florida. We use Freshdesk as our ticketing system, and I wanted to reach out regarding user permissions. Would it be possible to grant external users the ability to \"edit and search\" the tickets they have submitted? This feature would greatly enhance their workflow and productivity. Since I'm part of the IT team, I receive incoming tickets, and I’ve noticed a recurring issue. For example, if our QC team submits a ticket for a defective laptop that needs replacement, but later realizes they forgot to mention a cracked screen, they have no option to update the existing ticket. Instead, they create a \"new ticket\", which can lead to clutter and inefficiencies. Non Freshdesk Agent users (For Ex:, HR department, QC, etc ) submit dozens of tickets daily, or even hundreds per month, and the inability to modify their submissions often leads to unnecessary duplicate tickets. Since they are not Freshdesk Agents, they currently lack permissions to \"edit and search\" their own tickets. Would you be able to suggest the best approach to allow Non-Agents (external users) to edit and search their previously submitted tickets without granting them full Agent permissions? Ideally, we’d like them to be able to update their own tickets without gaining broader system access. I’d appreciate any insights or recommendations you might have on this. Looking forward to your response! Best regards, Anderson AirPro Diagnostics",

We are constantly working to improve our platform and may consider adding this feature in the future.  \n*05:52 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Aparna:**  \nAs we got customers asking for this feature before, I will loop in your request to the pipelined feature request. We highly appreciate your valuable feedback. Rest assured that we will forward all suggestions to our product team. They will assess the demand and feasibility of suggestions and include them in our feature request roadmap accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.  \n*05:53 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Smarten - Solution Team:**  \nOk, another question  \n*05:54 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Aparna:**  \nSure  \n*05:54 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Smarten - Solution Team:**  \nLet's say, I search a term \"dataset\", it shows me the result and shows the folder name.  \n*05:54 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Smarten - Solution Team:**  \nBut instead of showing the folder name, I want to show the full path.  \n*05:54 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Smarten - Solution Team:**  \nSo let's say I have folders like dataset -> Create dataset -> view dataset -> Update. Now all above folders, I have dataset in common. When I search term \"dataset\" it shows me only dataset in result, can I show the folder?  \n*05:55 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Aparna:**  \nAllow me some time to get this checked.  \n*05:57 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Smarten - Solution Team:**  \nPlease  \n*05:57 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Smarten - Solution Team:**  \nSee in the above screenshot. I want to show the full path of those folders.  \n*05:59 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Aparna:**  \nI comprehend that you wish to obtain the hierarchy of all the articles, specifically which articles belong to which folder and category. Correct me if I am wrong.  \n*06:00 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Smarten - Solution Team:**  \nYes  \n*06:01 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Smarten - Solution Team:**  \nFull path  \n*06:01 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Aparna:**  \nThis request appears to be valid, and I will submit a feature request on your behalf since we currently do not support this feature.  \n*06:02 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Smarten - Solution Team:**  \nSeems these are very basic.  \n*06:02 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Smarten - Solution Team:**  \nSomehow, can I get this using coding in the theme?  \n*06:03 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Smarten - Solution Team:**  \nCan anyone help me in changing a theme code and achieve this?  \n*06:03 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Aparna:**  \nAs this necessitates customization, it falls outside our scope. You will need to contact your developer for assistance with these customizations.  \n*06:04 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Aparna:**  \nFor this feature to be accessible in the future, I will need to turn this chat into a ticket and submit a request for it. I appreciate your understanding.  \n*06:08 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Aparna:**  \nAre we connected?  \n*06:09 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Aparna:**  \nI will convert this chat to a ticket and loop in the feature request. This chat will be marked resolved. You can ignore that. We can continue the conversation via email. Have a great day!  \n*06:10 AM, 20th Jan*  \n\n**Take to Team Inbox**"

Your objective is to analyze and cluster these feature requests into coherent and meaningful groups that will help prioritize future product features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "1. **Cluster Assignment:**  \n",
    "   - Ensure every feature request is assigned to exactly one cluster.\n",
    "   - Group requests based on their semantic similarity. Consider both the **SUBJECT** and the **DESCRIPTION**.\n",
    "   - Create clusters that are neither too broad (losing important distinctions) nor too narrow (fragmenting similar requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cluster Description:**  \n",
    "   - For each cluster, provide a concise description summarizing the shared theme or need.\n",
    "   - Focus on actionable themes that can inform feature development decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Granularity & Interpretability:**  \n",
    "   - Balance the level of abstraction so that clusters are meaningful, interpretable, and useful for guiding product enhancements.\n",
    "   - Avoid over-merging distinct topics or creating overly fragmented clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output Format:**  \n",
    "   - Respond with a JSON object in the exact format below, with no additional text:\n",
    "  { \"clusters\": [ { \"description\": \"short description of the cluster\", \"feature_requests\": [list of feature request numbers that belong to this cluster] } // ... additional clusters ] }\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format\n",
    "- A numbered list of feature requests is provided below.\n",
    "- Each feature request has a **SUBJECT** and a **DESCRIPTION**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "Based on the input, analyze the content and cluster the feature requests into groups with clear and actionable descriptions. Then, output the JSON structure with each cluster’s description and the list of feature request numbers that belong to it.\n",

I am trained to answer in English, Hindi, Spanish, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Portuguese (BR), Swedish, German and French. 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Yes, it is possible to ask users for their email before starting a conversation with an AI agent and make it required. You can configure your bot conversation settings to include mandatory questions such as capturing the user's email. Here are the steps to do that: 1. Set Up Bot Questions: - Go to Admin > Bots and use the Enabled/Disabled toggle to turn on the bot interaction. - Edit the default questions or add custom questions to capture user information before proceeding with the conversation. By default, the bot questions include capturing the Email, Name, and Phone number. You can configure these questions to validate responses to ensure they meet required formats (e.g., a valid email format). 2. Customization: - You can add custom questions by clicking on Add Custom Question and entering the required details such as the label, text, and response type. You can also specify validation messages if the user provides an invalid response. 3. Validation: - Configure negative validation responses for the questions. For example, if the user's reply to the Email ID question is invalid, you can prompt them with a message like \"Oops..Please enter a valid email ID\". 4. Workflow Configuration: - The Hallway Lead Bot allows you to collect user information such as name, email, and phone, validate responses with follow-up questions, and set appropriate messages if responses are invalid. By ensuring these configurations, the bot will prompt and validate the required user information, like an email ID, before proceeding with any conversation. For more information and detailed steps, you can refer to sources about setting up and customizing bot interactions and workflows.

       "**03:38 PM, 27th Jan**\n",

       "**Freddy:** Yes, you can filter chats based on labels. Freshchat allows you to add labels to conversations which can be used to categorize them based on the type of query. You can then filter these conversations to create custom views or metrics. To categorize conversations using labels, you can add them under Settings → Labels → Add Label on your Freshchat dashboard. Additionally, Freshchat also supports creating custom conversation views based on various filters including these labels. Furthermore, you can track the volume of tickets associated with different labels to analyze the pattern and distribution of incoming requests. If you want to view or filter conversations in real-time, you can do so from the Conversations logs page where you can apply filters such as time, conversation status, or labels to customize your list.  \n",

You can utilize the widget actions provided, specifically the options to open the chat widget, minimize and show messages proactively. Here are the action steps you can take: 1. Auto open chat widget: This opens the chat widget even without the customer clicking on it, which could indirectly ensure the \"send\" button is visible. 2. Configure your chat widget basic settings: Ensure that the necessary settings such as enabling the chat widget by default, configuring the javascript functions to initialize and show the widget are properly set up. 3. Specify action triggers: Set up the necessary triggers or events that would open the chat widget and expose the \"send\" button when a customer interacts with the bot. If you need more detailed steps for specific settings or actions, please let me know!

To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 02:05 AM, 30th Jan Paul Mendoza Hi there, how can I activate a \"send\" button in the chat? 02:05 AM, 30th Jan Freddy To activate the \"send\" button in the chat, you need to ensure the setup properly. You can utilize the widget actions provided, specifically the options to open the chat widget, minimize and show messages proactively. Here are the action steps you can take: 1. Auto open chat widget: This opens the chat widget even without the customer clicking on it, which could indirectly ensure the \"send\" button is visible. 2. Configure your chat widget basic settings: Ensure that the necessary settings such as enabling the chat widget by default, configuring the javascript functions to initialize and show the widget are properly set up. 3. Specify action triggers: Set up the necessary triggers or events that would open the chat widget and expose the \"send\" button when a customer interacts with the bot. If you need more detailed steps for specific settings or actions, please let me know!

Zie de documentatie over geavanceerde automatiseringen voor meer details over instellingen en triggers. Meer informatie: How can I notify customers/visitors about a response which have not been viewed by them, yet? 09:17 PM, 16th Jan Freddy Wat dit nuttig? 09:17 PM, 16th Jan Lorenzo DBM Nee 09:18 PM, 16th Jan Freddy Het spijt me te horen dat ik u niet heb kunnen helpen. 09:18 PM, 16th Jan Lorenzo DBM Kan ik een medewerker te woord staan? 09:18 PM, 16th Jan Harish Hello Lorenzo, I hope you are doing well. I am Harish from Freshchat Support. Could you please elaborate your Freshchat query? I will be happy to help you. 09:19 PM, 16th Jan Lorenzo DBM Goedemiddag Harish, Zie foto. Het gaat namelijk over het reageren op een sociale media post. Maar zie foto als wij een tegen reactie geven gaat dit via DM Maar dat willen wij niet wij willen namelijk dat wij vanuit de chat direct onder de post een reactie kunnen geven. 09:20 PM, 16th Jan Harish Could you please provide us with the screenshot? Unfortunately, I did not receive anything in the previous response. 09:22 PM, 16th Jan Lorenzo DBM 09:23 PM, 16th Jan Lorenzo DBM Bovenstaande betreft een Facebook post. 09:25 PM, 16th Jan Harish Please allow me a moment to check this. 09:26 PM, 16th Jan Lorenzo DBM Uiteraard. 09:26 PM, 16th Jan Harish I checked and verified that the product behaviour is that a reply from Freshchat to a Facebook comment will be sent as a DM. This is the default behaviour across all freshchat accounts. 09:28 PM, 16th Jan Lorenzo DBM Oké bedankt voor de toelichting.

How can I assist you today? 03:10 PM, 17th Jan BoomTech Support Support I use AI bot I want to ask user for email before conversioation and need it to be required is it possible? 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Could you please provide more details about the AI bot or the system you are referring to? This will help me assist you better. For instance, is it a chatbot on a specific platform or part of a particular software or service? 03:15 PM, 17th Jan BoomTech Support Support I mena new AI Agent 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Apologies! I am trained to answer in English, Hindi, Spanish, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Portuguese (BR), Swedish, German and French. 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Yes, it is possible to ask users for their email before starting a conversation with an AI agent and make it required. You can configure your bot conversation settings to include mandatory questions such as capturing the user's email. Here are the steps to do that: 1. Set Up Bot Questions: - Go to Admin > Bots and use the Enabled/Disabled toggle to turn on the bot interaction. - Edit the default questions or add custom questions to capture user information before proceeding with the conversation. By default, the bot questions include capturing the Email, Name, and Phone number. You can configure these questions to validate responses to ensure they meet required formats (e.g., a valid email format). 2. Customization: - You can add custom questions by clicking on Add Custom Question and entering the required details such as the label, text, and response type. You can also specify validation messages if the user provides an invalid response. 3. Validation: - Configure negative validation responses for the questions. For example, if the user's reply to the Email ID question is invalid, you can prompt them with a message like \"Oops..Please enter a valid email ID\". 4. Workflow Configuration: - The Hallway Lead Bot allows you to collect user information such as name, email, and phone, validate responses with follow-up questions, and set appropriate messages if responses are invalid. By ensuring these configurations, the bot will prompt and validate the required user information, like an email ID, before proceeding with any conversation. For more information and detailed steps, you can refer to sources about setting up and customizing bot interactions and workflows.

You can utilize the widget actions provided, specifically the options to open the chat widget, minimize and show messages proactively. Here are the action steps you can take: 1. Auto open chat widget: This opens the chat widget even without the customer clicking on it, which could indirectly ensure the \"send\" button is visible. 2. Configure your chat widget basic settings: Ensure that the necessary settings such as enabling the chat widget by default, configuring the javascript functions to initialize and show the widget are properly set up. 3.

For example, if February 1st is specified, will the imported holiday data for January be for the following year (2026)? 2. The import instructions state, \"Importing will only add this year's holidays...\". Does \"this year\" refer to January 1st to December 31st of the same calendar year (e.g., February 1st, 2025, to December 31st, 2025)? Or does it mean a one-year period starting from the specified date (e.g., February 1st, 2025, to January 31st, 2026)? 3. When holidays span across years, how should holidays be set up to stop the SLA timer effectively?

If your account has more than one workspace, navigate to Admin > {Worskpace Name} > Account Settings > Email Notifications > Tickets. 3. Disable Requester Notification for 'Agent adds comment to Ticket'. 4. Click on any ticket from the Dashboard or Ticket List View to open the ticket. 5.

To give you some context, I'm working on the Employee Onboarding module for our company, and our HR accidentally entered the new hire's name incorrectly. She put in Lara when it should have been Laura. \n",

Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 09:49 AM, 15th Jan David Tran Are we able to set email reminders for solution articles that are expiring? 09:50 AM, 15th Jan Freddy To set email reminders for solution articles that are expiring, you can utilize Scheduled Workflows in Freshservice. Here’s how you can do it: 1. Navigate to Admin > Automation & Productivity > Workflow Automator. 2. Click on 'New Workflow' and select 'Article' as the module. 3. Set a Scheduled event to define when the workflow should run, e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly. 4. Add a scheduled condition to filter solution articles based on the expiry date. 5.

Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 08:56 AM, 16th Jan Tabarak Mohammed hi 08:56 AM, 16th Jan Freddy Hello! How can I assist you today? 08:56 AM, 16th Jan Tabarak Mohammed setup custom priority 08:57 AM, 16th Jan Freddy To set up custom priority in Freshservice, you can utilize the Priority Matrix feature which allows you to automatically set the priority of tickets based on the urgency and impact fields. Here’s how you can do it: 1. Navigate to Admin > Service Management > Helpdesk Settings > Priority Matrix. 2. Toggle the Enable Priority Matrix switch to ON on the Priority Matrix page. 3. Set the values for the Urgency and Impact fields according to your organization's requirements, defining priority levels from Low to Urgent. 4. Click Save to save your changes. From now on, when a ticket is created or updated, Freshservice will automatically set the ticket's priority based on the values selected for Urgency and Impact. You can also configure the priority matrix to allow requesters to set the Urgency and Impact values while submitting the ticket. To do this: 1.

Here are the steps to create the workflow: 1. Navigate to Admin -> Workflow Automator -> New Automator -> Ticket. 2. Drag and drop the event node and select 'Service Request is Updated' when the Background Check is marked as complete. 3. Add a condition node to specify other necessary conditions. 4. Finally, drag and drop the action node and select 'Create Child Ticket' with the appropriate API call to create the child ticket. This workflow will ensure that a child ticket is automatically created when the initial background check is completed by the HR team.

Unfortunately, we still have the same problem.  \n*09:45 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Saai:**  \nCan you please let us know your issue, since Abbas's shift is over?  \n*09:48 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Simon Alexander:**  \nThe export asset button disappears when we choose the facilities workspace.  \n*09:50 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Simon Alexander:**  \n*File attached - Export icon disappears.mp4*  \nHere is a video of the problem.  \n*09:50 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Simon Alexander:**  \nI was told they refreshed 'the cache' and it would take a couple of hours.  \n*09:50 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Saai:**  \nThis is because there is no asset associated with the specific workspace.  \n*09:52 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Saai:**  \nMoreover, to clarify, Asset is only available for the IT workspace and not to the other workspaces.  \n*09:52 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Saai:**  \nI hope this is clear.  \n*09:53 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Simon Alexander:**  \nWe have hundreds of assets in the facilities workspace.  \n*09:55 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Simon Alexander:**  \nAnd we used to be able to export.  \n*09:55 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Saai:**  \nAs a workaround, you can try to export all the assets and can segregate based on the workspace.  \n*09:59 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Saai:**  \nI think this can be helpful for you.  \n*10:00 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Simon Alexander:**  \nThis will work as a workaround. But I would like to fix the issue.  \n*10:03 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Saai:**  \nAs this requires further analysis, we will have to resolve this chat to create a ticket and you will receive an email with the ticket information. Before we proceed to resolve this, is there anything else we can assist you with?  \n*10:04 AM, 29th Jan*\n\n**Take to Team Inbox**",

         "Hi Harsha, Thank you for the excellent support. I have a question regarding service items and changing the entered values after the item request form has been submitted. To give you some context, I'm working on the Employee Onboarding module for our company, and our HR accidentally entered the new hire's name incorrectly, she put in Lara when it should have been Laura: Can the 'employee information' be changed through the ticket or would HR need to resubmit another onboarding request with the correct spelling to fix the error? I'm hoping that this data can be updated without having to resubmit another service item/onboarding request.

However, we do have a feature request in place with the product team, and I will go ahead and link this ticket to the feature request and keep you posted regarding any updates.  \n*05:19 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Lloyd Sylvester:**  \nNo, please let me know the reason for this behavior?  \n*05:19 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Jayashree:**  \nThis is because when users have the ability to edit their own role, other users with lesser roles can update their profile with the higher role, and this can be misused.  \n*05:20 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Lloyd Sylvester:**  \nWe are not talking about users, only Account Admins.  \n*05:20 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Lloyd Sylvester:**  \nThey should be having access to edit their own role.  \n*05:20 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Lloyd Sylvester:**  \nDon't need Freshworks team to come in and update our permission.  \n*05:20 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Jayashree:**  \nFor this purpose, we have restricted the ability for the agent to edit the role.  \n*05:20 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Lloyd Sylvester:**  \nThat is for agents.  \n*05:20 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Lloyd Sylvester:**  \nWhy for Account Admin?  \n*05:20 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Jayashree:**  \nUnderstood, and your request is completely valid.  \n*05:20 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Lloyd Sylvester:**  \nHe will be the only Account Admin.  \n*05:20 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Jayashree:**  \nThis includes all the users, including account admin. One cannot edit their role. They need to check with another admin, and once confirmed, alone their role can be changed.  \n*05:21 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Lloyd Sylvester:**  \nAre you not listening?  \n*05:22 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Lloyd Sylvester:**  \nThere is NO OTHER ADMIN.  \n*05:22 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Lloyd Sylvester:**  \nHow can I get full access?  \n*05:22 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Jayashree:**  \nWe will have complete access, but editing the role alone is not possible at this time.  \n*05:22 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Jayashree:**  \nA workaround would be to have a dummy agent profile with admin access, which you can use in case the roles need to be updated.  \n*05:23 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Jayashree:**  \nAs mentioned earlier, we do have a feature request in place with the product team, and I will go ahead and link this ticket to the feature request and keep you posted regarding any updates.  \n*05:24 AM, 30th Jan*  \n\n**Take to Team Inbox**",

For instance, is it a chatbot on a specific platform or part of a particular software or service?  \n**03:15 PM, 17th Jan**\n\n**BoomTech Support Support:** I mean new AI Agent.  \n**03:15 PM, 17th Jan**\n\n**Freddy:** Apologies! I am trained to answer in English, Hindi, Spanish, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Portuguese (BR), Swedish, German, and French.  \n**03:15 PM, 17th Jan**\n\n**Freddy:** Yes, it is possible to ask users for their email before starting a conversation with an AI agent and make it required. You can configure your bot conversation settings to include mandatory questions such as capturing the user's email. Here are the steps to do that:\n\n1. **Set Up Bot Questions:**\n   - Go to Admin > Bots and use the Enabled/Disabled toggle to turn on the bot interaction.\n   - Edit the default questions or add custom questions to capture user information before proceeding with the conversation. By default, the bot questions include capturing the Email, Name, and Phone number. You can configure these questions to validate responses to ensure they meet required formats (e.g., a valid email format).\n\n2. **Customization:**\n   - You can add custom questions by clicking on Add Custom Question and entering the required details such as the label, text, and response type. You can also specify validation messages if the user provides an invalid response.\n\n3. **Validation:**\n   - Configure negative validation responses for the questions. For example, if the user's reply to the Email ID question is invalid, you can prompt them with a message like \"Oops..Please enter a valid email ID\".\n\n4. **Workflow Configuration:**\n   - The Hallway Lead Bot allows you to collect user information such as name, email, and phone, validate responses with follow-up questions, and set appropriate messages if responses are invalid.\n\nBy ensuring these configurations, the bot will prompt and validate the required user information, like an email ID, before proceeding with any conversation. For more information and detailed steps, you can refer to sources about setting up and customizing bot interactions and workflows.

The settings which you have configured will only apply for the Chatbot/AI agent.  \n**03:22 PM, 17th Jan**\n\n**Vijayadarshan:** So, the AI agents will be triggered in the topic inside/outside business hours based on your configuration. The topic in itself will not be hidden.  \n**03:22 PM, 17th Jan**\n\n**Vijayadarshan:** Hope this is clear.  \n**03:22 PM, 17th Jan**\n\n**BoomTech Support Support:** But now both are triggered.  \n**03:23 PM, 17th Jan**\n\n**Vijayadarshan:** Got it.

Furthermore, you can track the volume of tickets associated with different labels to analyze the pattern and distribution of incoming requests.

I'm here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have. To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 12:50 PM, 08th Jan Julia Hoppe Hi, is it possible to postpone Freddy Suggests on another space? If I reply a ticket it is very uncomfortable because you cannot see if there is a communication before. 12:51 PM, 08th Jan Freddy Yes, you can handle Freddy Suggests' recommendations when replying to a ticket, which can help you avoid the inconvenience of not seeing previous communications. You can manage suggestions by accepting, rejecting, or ignoring them. Here's how you can manage suggestions: 1. Accepting Suggestions: When you accept a suggestion, you approve the suggestion and update the ticket field value accordingly. You can accept a suggestion from the 'Freddy suggestions' drop-down or from an individual ticket field's drop-down. 2. Ignoring Suggestions: When you ignore a suggestion, you take no action on it.

If I reply a ticket it is very uncomfortable because you cannot see if there is a communication before. 12:51 PM, 08th Jan Freddy Yes, you can handle Freddy Suggests' recommendations when replying to a ticket, which can help you avoid the inconvenience of not seeing previous communications. You can manage suggestions by accepting, rejecting, or ignoring them. Here's how you can manage suggestions: 1. Accepting Suggestions: When you accept a suggestion, you approve the suggestion and update the ticket field value accordingly. You can accept a suggestion from the 'Freddy suggestions' drop-down or from an individual ticket field's drop-down. 2. Ignoring Suggestions: When you ignore a suggestion, you take no action on it.

I'm Freddy, your friendly AI agent! ? I'm here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have. To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 04:21 PM, 08th Jan Charlotte Salt can you get up different escalation processes based on priority 04:22 PM, 08th Jan Freddy I found information on setting up different escalation processes based on priority: - To set up SLA reminders and escalations: You can configure escalation rules for tickets that violate their SLA deadlines and choose to have notifications sent for tickets under specific priorities. You can define escalation rules and assign specific agents to receive these escalation emails. - You can set up multiple levels of escalations: Up to four levels of escalation can be defined for when a ticket is not resolved on time. This helps in ensuring that tickets are appropriately escalated based on their priority. For additional details, I recommend checking the specific settings in your Freshdesk account under Admin > Workflows > SLA Policies. Let me know if you need further assistance or more specific steps! 04:22 PM, 08th Jan Freddy Was I helpful? Your feedback matters! 04:22 PM, 08th Jan Charlotte Salt No 04:22 PM, 08th Jan Freddy I'm sorry to hear that it wasn't helpful. Let me quickly connect you with a specialist. 04:22 PM, 08th Jan Aravind Hello there, this is Aravind from Freshdesk support. How are you doing today? 04:23 PM, 08th Jan Charlotte Salt I am well thank you how are you? 04:24 PM, 08th Jan Aravind I'm good too, thank you for asking! How may I assist you today? 04:24 PM, 08th Jan Charlotte Salt I want to set up escalations for my SLA's however I want it to escalate differently based ont h e priority, can this be achieved? 04:25 PM, 08th Jan Aravind The SLA escalation would be sent based on the priority. Let us assume a case of a custom SLA policy with the following resolution SLA values Low priority - 2 days Medium priority - 1 day High priority - 12 h Therefore, if the ticket is in high priority, the resolution SLA would be due after 12 hours and the SLA escalation email would be triggered based on this flag 04:27 PM, 08th Jan Charlotte Salt yes but when teh escalations are set up if a high priority one is due I want it to go to myself but if it is due and a low prioioirity i want it to go to another agent 04:27 PM, 08th Jan Aravind Thank you for clarifying.

       "DESCRIPTION: Freddy Hi Charlotte Salt! I'm Freddy, your friendly AI agent! ? I'm here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have. To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 04:21 PM, 08th Jan Charlotte Salt can you get up different escalation processes based on priority 04:22 PM, 08th Jan Freddy I found information on setting up different escalation processes based on priority: - To set up SLA reminders and escalations: You can configure escalation rules for tickets that violate their SLA deadlines and choose to have notifications sent for tickets under specific priorities. You can define escalation rules and assign specific agents to receive these escalation emails. - You can set up multiple levels of escalations: Up to four levels of escalation can be defined for when a ticket is not resolved on time. This helps in ensuring that tickets are appropriately escalated based on their priority. For additional details, I recommend checking the specific settings in your Freshdesk account under Admin > Workflows > SLA Policies. Let me know if you need further assistance or more specific steps! 04:22 PM, 08th Jan Freddy Was I helpful?

Let us assume a case of a custom SLA policy with the following resolution SLA values Low priority - 2 days Medium priority - 1 day High priority - 12 h Therefore, if the ticket is in high priority, the resolution SLA would be due after 12 hours and the SLA escalation email would be triggered based on this flag 04:27 PM, 08th Jan Charlotte Salt yes but when teh escalations are set up if a high priority one is due I want it to go to myself but if it is due and a low prioioirity i want it to go to another agent 04:27 PM, 08th Jan Aravind Thank you for clarifying.

Here are a few options: 1. Modifying the sorting order of Thread conversations: You can decide how Threads are arranged within the ticket by choosing between 'Date created' or 'Last updated'. You can update these settings in your profile settings. 2. Creating Private Threads: You can start a Private Thread on a Private/Public Note or customer/agent response to collaborate with different stakeholders in a chat-like interface. Private threads can be accessed by clicking on the Private Thread button on the Private or Public Note. 3. Using Discussion Threads: Discussion Threads allow you to discuss a ticket with internal or external stakeholders and tag specific agents. This can be useful when you need to collaborate closely with others on resolving a ticket. 4.

This one is called \"Customer responded\". This is great, as it visualizes it, however quite useless since we cannot filter for it. We tried filtering for it as a tag, but the tag does not exist 07:41 PM, 10th Jan Freddy You can filter tickets based on tags or other criteria using the Filter Tickets section of the Ticket view page. To achieve this, follow these steps: 1. Apply the necessary filters under the Filter Tickets section. 2. Click on the Tick mark next to the list view name (e.g., All tickets) to save these filters. 3. Give the filter a relevant heading, which you can use later. Here's a detailed article that will help you set it up. Furthermore, if you have already enabled tags for tickets and still cannot filter by the \"Customer responded\" tag, it might be a good idea to check the setup or permissions related to tag handling and custom tag filters in your admin settings.

However, we seem unable to filter for this tag? 07:54 PM, 10th Jan Aravind That's great to know, Karl. The \"Customer responded\" tag is not a ticket tag, however, is a default system flag that is displayed in Freshdesk whenever customers respond to the ticket thread. Unfortunately, it would not be possible to filter using this flag as this filtering functionality has not been built into the product yet.

Why do I have to modify the code? 09:34 PM, 10th Jan Shivani This is a formatting issue, not a system issue. 09:34 PM, 10th Jan Marjana Cowan No one manually updated headings.

       "DESCRIPTION: Marjana Cowan So why didn't the system do this? Why do I have to modify the code? 09:32 PM, 10th Jan Freddy The system automation rules might not be executing due to various reasons such as the way the rules are set up, if the 'New email' option was used instead of 'New Ticket', or if the requester is an agent. You might need to modify the code or settings to fix these issues. For detailed troubleshooting steps, you can refer to the provided information. Read More: Why are my automations not working?

Why do I have to modify the code? 09:34 PM, 10th Jan Shivani This is a formatting issue, not a system issue. 09:34 PM, 10th Jan Marjana Cowan No one manually updated headings.

Looks like the class is missing/ not defined in the code which you've added for the TOC. 09:39 PM, 10th Jan Shivani Hence, you'd have to make the changes in the script as suggested. 09:40 PM, 10th Jan Marjana Cowan I understand this... but my question is more around why did the text editor not create the required class when the TOC was created? 09:41 PM, 10th Jan Marjana Cowan While your proposed resolution will fix the immediate issue, we aren't addressing the larger problem of the system not performing correctly. 09:42 PM, 10th Jan Marjana Cowan the text editor, specifically 09:42 PM, 10th Jan Shivani I see, thank you for the clarity.

Diese scheinen für Bilder in den Artikeln AWS zu nutzen. Das wird in China blockiert. Freshdesk benötigt dafür eine ICP Lizenz um Inhalte von AWS in China anzeigen zu können. Wenn das Support-Portal in China funktionieren muss, hätte der Anwendungsfall bei der Auswahl des Produkts als Anforderung berücksichtigt werden müssen.

I have filters applied not to include closed ticket but the data still includes closed tickets 07:02 PM, 14th Jan Freddy Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue with filters in analytics not excluding closed tickets: 1. Review Your Report Setup: - Ensure the widget settings have the correct filters. - Check if there are report-wide filters in place, as well as widget or page-level filters that could be affecting the data. 2. Validate the Data and Filters: - Make sure you have applied the filter correctly at the widget level by dragging and dropping the widget and entering the necessary filter criteria. 3. Check Historical Data: - If the data involves historical metrics, it may be counting all changes made to tickets, not just their current status. 4. Check for Data Period Conflicts: - Ensure that the page filter and widget filter align. Verify if the date range and dimensions properly reflect the needed data. 5. Analyze Unexpected Results: - If unexpected tickets, like closed ones, are showing up in analytics, review a few sample tickets using the \"Show Activities\" feature to trace their actions and understand why they might appear in the data despite applying filters. Following these steps should help troubleshoot and correct inaccuracies in your analytics data. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Freshdesk support for further assistance with your findings.

       "Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue with filters in analytics not excluding closed tickets:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Review Your Report Setup:**  \n",
       "   - Ensure the widget settings have the correct filters.  \n",
       "   - Check if there are report-wide filters in place, as well as widget or page-level filters that could be affecting the data.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Validate the Data and Filters:**  \n",
       "   - Make sure you have applied the filter correctly at the widget level by dragging and dropping the widget and entering the necessary filter criteria.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Check Historical Data:**  \n",
       "   - If the data involves historical metrics, it may be counting all changes made to tickets, not just their current status.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Check for Data Period Conflicts:**  \n",
       "   - Ensure that the page filter and widget filter align. Verify if the date range and dimensions properly reflect the needed data.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Analyze Unexpected Results:**  \n",
       "   - If unexpected tickets, like closed ones, are showing up in analytics, review a few sample tickets using the \"Show Activities\" feature to trace their actions and understand why they might appear in the data despite applying filters.\n",
       "\n",
       "Following these steps should help troubleshoot and correct inaccuracies in your analytics data. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Freshdesk support for further assistance with your findings.  \n",

Could you please provide more details about the issue? Specifically: 1. Is the email being triggered by a specific automation or rule in Freshdesk? 2. Have there been any recent changes to your email configurations or automations? This will help me narrow down the issue and provide a more accurate solution. 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 1. No 2. No 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Freddy Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your description, it sounds like there may be a bug or a configuration issue causing the email to loop. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try: 1. Check for duplicate automations or rules: Although you mentioned there were no changes, ensure there's no overlapping rule causing the duplication. 2. Review email logs: Check email logs within Freshdesk to identify the initiation point and frequency of the email being sent. 3. Disable and Re-enable Outgoing Emails: Temporarily disable the outgoing email configurations and then re-enable them to see if it stops the loop. 4. Inspect Email Template: Make sure the email template being used is not corrupted or has embedded links causing the loop. If the issue persists after these steps, it may require further investigation by our support team. Would you like me to transfer you to a support agent to assist you with resolving this issue? 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel No please connect me to a human agent 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Freddy Sure, let me put you in touch with one of our agents. 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Hi there, Constantin. This is Siddharth from the Freshdesk team. How are you doing today? 04:05 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Could you elaborate on the issue a bit more with the screenshot to the ticket and the looping that is happening, Constantin? 04:06 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Hello. We have an urgent problem - this already happend twice with freshdesk in the last year, but we also with support couldn't identify the reason. However, please look that you stop the message loop- Freshdesk keeps sending the same message again and again since yesterday: Ticket 36715 04:07 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:08 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Which exact message, Constantin? Could you share the screenshots of the duplicates as well? 04:08 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Look we only see the duplicates since we get via the BCC the duplicates sent 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel I cannot see it in freshdesk browser! 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel But it is being sent by freshdesk 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Could you share the Email header file of two emails from the mailbox so that I could back trace this from the logs? And the email address getting the duplicate emails is office@poolwonder.com am I right here? 04:11 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Re: Problème Nouveau message via le formulaire de contact 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Re: Problème Nouveau message via le formulaire de contact 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:13 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel The bcc is office@poolwonder.com but the original adress is steve@beautyfulljeanne.com 04:13 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel We just noted that the e-mail adress of the customer is incorrect: steve@beautyfulljeanne.com , however is this freshdesk behaviour to try to resend again and again if mail is incorrect? therefore we get the bcc? 04:17 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Looks like there were multiple retries for the email, Constantin. Is there a specific reason why the Bcc is there, Constantin? You can remove the automatic Bcc if this is added by mistake, by navigating to Admin > Channel > email > Advanced email settings > Edit automatic BCC 04:18 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Yes, you are right. We have a retry policy on our end if the email sent is not delivered. 04:18 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Yes the bcc is in place so we actually know about problems like this. because otherwise i guess we would not have known that there is a problem with delivering the mail...? 04:19 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Is there a way to edit this retry policy and limit to only 3 retries for example and get notified if all 3 retries were not successful? 04:20 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth I'm afraid that the retry policy is something that is set on a product level, Constantin, and sincere apologies on the delay in response here. 04:23 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth The retries cannot be limited on an account level, so the retries would happen and eventually, we would suppress the user because of too many bounces. 04:24 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth This is the functionality of the emails sent from Freshdesk as of now. 04:25 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel and if no cc in place how would we find out about the problem then? 04:25 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth This issue is something that we have discussed internally, Constantin. We do have an \"Undelivered\" tag that we add from our end to the product's ticket page when the email is not delivered. But, this is something that is limited to the \"Freshdesk mail servers\" as of now and due to the complexities of the custom mailbox and it's attribute returns from the mailbox. 04:29 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth As of now, your account uses the Custom mailbox configuration, so the Undelivered tag will not be added, and we do have a feature request raised with our product team for the same and we are discussing this, Constantin. The issue where it becomes complex for us is the return of attributes. 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel and what do you mean by suppressing the user? Do you mean my account or the e-mail from my customer? 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth The email address of the recipient. 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel okay thank you for clarification ! 04:31 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth So say, there is a false email address whose email address is not reachable 04:31 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth We would attempt the email delivery for the address and after multiple bounces and email validation, we would suppress the user as this uses up the mailserver resources. 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth And after 7 days, the user is unsuppressed. 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel so you suppress the e-mail address of the recipient 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel not my user account of freshdesk 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth yes, not the user account on Freshdesk. It is strictly done for the end user address. 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Okay thank you ! I hope that feature request gets pushed because this is a serious bug in my opinion. 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Have a nice day, all the best! 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Noted the same, Constantin.

This app allows you to prevent agents from editing the groups while keeping the other required fields visible and functional.

Your feedback matters! 06:48 PM, 16th Jan Ben Doyle Sorry that does not work. The column still shows up even when the field is hidden 06:51 PM, 16th Jan Freddy It seems there is currently an identified issue in Freshdesk where attempting to delete the group name in the table view from the tickets list view causes it to reappear. The developers are aware of this bug and are working on a fix. As of now, there isn't a method to specifically remove just the \"Group\" column without also removing the \"Agent\" column due to this bug.

This will help me assist you better. For instance, is it a chatbot on a specific platform or part of a particular software or service? 03:15 PM, 17th Jan BoomTech Support Support I mena new AI Agent 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Apologies! I am trained to answer in English, Hindi, Spanish, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Portuguese (BR), Swedish, German and French. 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Yes, it is possible to ask users for their email before starting a conversation with an AI agent and make it required. You can configure your bot conversation settings to include mandatory questions such as capturing the user's email. Here are the steps to do that: 1. Set Up Bot Questions: - Go to Admin > Bots and use the Enabled/Disabled toggle to turn on the bot interaction. - Edit the default questions or add custom questions to capture user information before proceeding with the conversation. By default, the bot questions include capturing the Email, Name, and Phone number. You can configure these questions to validate responses to ensure they meet required formats (e.g., a valid email format). 2. Customization: - You can add custom questions by clicking on Add Custom Question and entering the required details such as the label, text, and response type. You can also specify validation messages if the user provides an invalid response. 3. Validation: - Configure negative validation responses for the questions. For example, if the user's reply to the Email ID question is invalid, you can prompt them with a message like \"Oops..Please enter a valid email ID\". 4. Workflow Configuration: - The Hallway Lead Bot allows you to collect user information such as name, email, and phone, validate responses with follow-up questions, and set appropriate messages if responses are invalid. By ensuring these configurations, the bot will prompt and validate the required user information, like an email ID, before proceeding with any conversation. For more information and detailed steps, you can refer to sources about setting up and customizing bot interactions and workflows.

The change from \"Open and Pending requests\" to \"All Tickets\" might have been adjusted in the Portal Settings.

Manage Sections: - Switch to the \"Manage sections\" tab. - Customize Tickets, Knowledge Base, and Forums as needed. - You can control visibility and default ticket forms. 3. Adjust Ticket Visibility: - Here you can control which ticket statuses are visible by default. - You can allow only logged-in users to view tickets or everyone with the public ticket URL. For further customizing the ticket view options, you can use the options available for viewing tickets on the customer portal by setting up ticket fields and filtering options: - Allow Users to Filter Tickets: - Add ticket fields as filters on the customer portal. Only Dropdowns and Dependent ticket fields can be added as filter options. If you need additional customization or run into issues, you might want to check the detailed portal configuration available in your admin settings.

We use Freshdesk as our ticketing system, and I wanted to reach out regarding user permissions. Would it be possible to grant external users the ability to \"edit and search\" the tickets they have submitted? This feature would greatly enhance their workflow and productivity. Since I'm part of the IT team, I receive incoming tickets, and I’ve noticed a recurring issue. For example, if our QC team submits a ticket for a defective laptop that needs replacement, but later realizes they forgot to mention a cracked screen, they have no option to update the existing ticket. Instead, they create a \"new ticket\", which can lead to clutter and inefficiencies. Non Freshdesk Agent users (For Ex:, HR department, QC, etc ) submit dozens of tickets daily, or even hundreds per month, and the inability to modify their submissions often leads to unnecessary duplicate tickets. Since they are not Freshdesk Agents, they currently lack permissions to \"edit and search\" their own tickets. Would you be able to suggest the best approach to allow Non-Agents (external users) to edit and search their previously submitted tickets without granting them full Agent permissions? Ideally, we’d like them to be able to update their own tickets without gaining broader system access. I’d appreciate any insights or recommendations you might have on this.

As much as I can help you here, I'm afraid Freshdesk currently does not support the feature to delete Customer Replies on the ticket automatically / manually. Only the agent replies can be deleted. However I agree that the automated response you receive in your use case can be annoying. I would like to propose a workaround for this 12:06 PM, 21st Jan Swaran You can split the specific note on the ticket so it gets created as a new ticket. splitting the response will automatically remove the note from this ticket and will get populated as a new ticket. You can Spam/Delete the new ticket and refresh the old ticket page so that the response is removed from the ticket 12:08 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng can this action be automatically done with automations or other function? 12:08 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng or can I set up somewhere to make this certain contact's email create a new ticket rather than involved in the original ticket? 12:09 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng for other tickets I still need the replied be thread in the same ticket 12:10 PM, 21st Jan Swaran Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to set up splitting of a ticket via automation. Hence the workaround was suggested. Regarding setting up a rule to have this certain contact's email come as a new ticket is also not possible. However, I personally completely understand your requirement of being able to delete the customer responses. I will have your valuable feedback passed in to our product team so they can possibly check the feasibility of having this added as a feature enhancement. 12:10 PM, 21st Jan Swaran The only way currently to have the note not displayed on the ticket is splitting the note manually. 12:11 PM, 21st Jan Swaran You will hear from us to \"amphee.meng@pkfare.com\" shortly where I will have a ticket created and raise the feature request on our behalf.

Here is a step-by-step guide that you can follow: 1. Navigate to your Freshdesk account. 2. Go to Admin -> Ticket fields and create a new ticket field for organization. 3. Install the conversation sync app from the Freshdesk marketplace. 4. Validate the configuration by entering the Freshdesk account URL and the API key. For more detailed instructions and links to additional resources, you can refer to the relevant documentation. This setup should help sync all internal note threads and more within your tickets correspondingly.

I'm Freddy, your friendly AI agent! ? I'm here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have. To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 08:52 PM, 24th Jan Franck Coppola Coppola My Kanban board does not display all open tickets. Count open tickets : 78 but only 30 displayed in Kanban. 08:53 PM, 24th Jan Freddy It appears you are experiencing an issue where your Kanban board is displaying only 30 out of 78 open tickets. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue: 1. Check Ticket Filters: Ensure there are no filters applied on the Kanban board that might be restricting the display to only 30 tickets. Filters can sometimes limit the visible tickets based on certain criteria. 2. Adjust Ticket Views: Verify if the Kanban board view settings allow for viewing more than 30 tickets. Adjust the settings to increase the number of visible tickets per page to 50 or 100 if possible. 3. Session Settings: Keep in mind that the selection of tickets per page (30, 50, or 100) is local to an agent and reset per session.

       "DESCRIPTION: Freddy Hi Franck Coppola! I'm Freddy, your friendly AI agent! ? I'm here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have. To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 08:52 PM, 24th Jan Franck Coppola Coppola My Kanban board does not display all open tickets. Count open tickets : 78 but only 30 displayed in Kanban. 08:53 PM, 24th Jan Freddy It appears you are experiencing an issue where your Kanban board is displaying only 30 out of 78 open tickets. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue: 1. Check Ticket Filters: Ensure there are no filters applied on the Kanban board that might be restricting the display to only 30 tickets. Filters can sometimes limit the visible tickets based on certain criteria. 2. Adjust Ticket Views: Verify if the Kanban board view settings allow for viewing more than 30 tickets. Adjust the settings to increase the number of visible tickets per page to 50 or 100 if possible. 3. Session Settings: Keep in mind that the selection of tickets per page (30, 50, or 100) is local to an agent and reset per session. Make sure the settings persist across sessions by confirming the settings before applying. 4. Layout and Sorting: Switch between Card View and Table View layouts, as different layouts may display different numbers of tickets. Check with your admin if specific layouts are enforced by default settings. If these steps do not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to customer support for further assistance.

Additionally, Freshchat also supports creating custom conversation views based on various filters including these labels. Furthermore, you can track the volume of tickets associated with different labels to analyze the pattern and distribution of incoming requests. If you want to view or filter conversations in real-time, you can do so from the Conversations logs page where you can apply filters such as time, conversation status, or labels to customize your list.  \n",

Here are the steps to create the workflow: 1. Navigate to Admin -> Workflow Automator -> New Automator -> Ticket. 2. Drag and drop the event node and select 'Service Request is Updated' when the Background Check is marked as complete. 3. Add a condition node to specify other necessary conditions. 4. Finally, drag and drop the action node and select 'Create Child Ticket' with the appropriate API call to create the child ticket. This workflow will ensure that a child ticket is automatically created when the initial background check is completed by the HR team.

Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 12:14 AM, 28th Jan Mark Wright would like child ticket to populate after HR completes background check 12:14 AM, 28th Jan Freddy To automatically create a child ticket after HR completes the background check, you would set up an automation using the Workflow Automator. Here are the steps to create the workflow: 1. Navigate to Admin -> Workflow Automator -> New Automator -> Ticket. 2. Drag and drop the event node and select 'Service Request is Updated' when the Background Check is marked as complete. 3. Add a condition node to specify other necessary conditions. 4. Finally, drag and drop the action node and select 'Create Child Ticket' with the appropriate API call to create the child ticket. This workflow will ensure that a child ticket is automatically created when the initial background check is completed by the HR team.

This means the 'Hours since [status]' condition cannot be configured to be based on business hours in the group. 05:40 AM, 28th Jan Jesse Davis I need to be able to set a status that pauses the SLA timer but only for a set number of days within the group's business hours. Once the number of days elapse, I need to resume SLA timer. Is this possible? 05:42 AM, 28th Jan Freddy In Freshdesk, you can manage SLA timers effectively by using the 'Pending' status to pause the SLA timer when waiting for a customer or other condition. Here’s how you can set it up for a specific number of days within the group's business hours and then resume: 1. Set the SLA policy: Go to Admin > Workflows > SLA Policies. Define the business hours specific to the group. 2. Create a new automation rule: Navigate to Admin > Workflows > Automations and choose to create a new rule with an hourly trigger. 3. Configure the trigger condition: Set the condition based on the ticket properties, for instance, 'Hours since pending' to specify the number of days within the business hours. 4. Pause the SLA timer: When the status is 'Pending,' the SLA timer is paused. Set an action to automatically change the status back after the specified number of days, resuming the SLA timer. This approach helps you control and manage the SLA based on business hours. However, the SLA clock in Freshdesk runs based on calendar hours not just business hours, ensure you carefully manage the status changes to align with your SLA policies. 05:43 AM, 28th Jan Jesse Davis I'd like to speak with an agent about this please 05:44 AM, 28th Jan Freddy Sure, let me put you in touch with one of our agents. 05:44 AM, 28th Jan Prateek Hey Jesse!

To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 10:33 PM, 28th Jan Jon England We have a field in our system called Status. When viewing the tickets in a list, we are able to quickly change the status by using a dropdown icon. We also have a field called Repair_Status. This also appears in the list, but does not have the ability of being changed. In order to change it we have to go into the ticket and change it there 10:36 PM, 28th Jan Freddy To modify how fields like 'Repair_Status' can be edited directly from the ticket list view, follow these steps: 1. Admin Settings: Go to Admin > Workflows > Ticket Fields. 2. Modify Field Properties: Click on the 'Repair_Status' field. In the properties pane, look for an option to enable inline edit or add it to the list view. 3. Set Permissions: Ensure that the 'Can Edit' property is enabled for agents, allowing them to modify this field directly from the ticket view. 4. Update Field Visibility: If the field needs to appear in the ticket listing, make sure it is not hidden and is configured to be visible and editable in the list view settings. These steps should help you enable inline editing for the 'Repair_Status' field similar to the 'Status' field.

       "DESCRIPTION: Freddy Hi Jon England! I'm Freddy, your friendly AI agent! ? I'm here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have. To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 10:33 PM, 28th Jan Jon England We have a field in our system called Status. When viewing the tickets in a list, we are able to quickly change the status by using a dropdown icon. We also have a field called Repair_Status. This also appears in the list, but does not have the ability of being changed. In order to change it we have to go into the ticket and change it there 10:36 PM, 28th Jan Freddy To modify how fields like 'Repair_Status' can be edited directly from the ticket list view, follow these steps: 1. Admin Settings: Go to Admin > Workflows > Ticket Fields. 2. Modify Field Properties: Click on the 'Repair_Status' field. In the properties pane, look for an option to enable inline edit or add it to the list view. 3. Set Permissions: Ensure that the 'Can Edit' property is enabled for agents, allowing them to modify this field directly from the ticket view. 4. Update Field Visibility: If the field needs to appear in the ticket listing, make sure it is not hidden and is configured to be visible and editable in the list view settings. These steps should help you enable inline editing for the 'Repair_Status' field similar to the 'Status' field.

Auto open chat widget: This opens the chat widget even without the customer clicking on it, which could indirectly ensure the \"send\" button is visible. 2.

To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 04:21 PM, 08th Jan Charlotte Salt can you get up different escalation processes based on priority 04:22 PM, 08th Jan Freddy I found information on setting up different escalation processes based on priority: - To set up SLA reminders and escalations: You can configure escalation rules for tickets that violate their SLA deadlines and choose to have notifications sent for tickets under specific priorities. You can define escalation rules and assign specific agents to receive these escalation emails. - You can set up multiple levels of escalations: Up to four levels of escalation can be defined for when a ticket is not resolved on time. This helps in ensuring that tickets are appropriately escalated based on their priority. For additional details, I recommend checking the specific settings in your Freshdesk account under Admin > Workflows > SLA Policies. Let me know if you need further assistance or more specific steps! 04:22 PM, 08th Jan Freddy Was I helpful?

Let us assume a case of a custom SLA policy with the following resolution SLA values Low priority - 2 days Medium priority - 1 day High priority - 12 h Therefore, if the ticket is in high priority, the resolution SLA would be due after 12 hours and the SLA escalation email would be triggered based on this flag 04:27 PM, 08th Jan Charlotte Salt yes but when teh escalations are set up if a high priority one is due I want it to go to myself but if it is due and a low prioioirity i want it to go to another agent 04:27 PM, 08th Jan Aravind Thank you for clarifying. At the moment, it would not be possible to trigger SLA escalations based on each priority.

Unfortunately, a dark mode browser addon doesn't cut it as copying and pasting and using canned responses inherits a black background or light grey text.\n\nWe are at the point where we are looking at migrating to Zoho Desk purely for this feature, because we have been waiting years and it is getting a bit ridiculous.\n\nKind regards,  \nBlair.",

Here are a few options: 1. Modifying the sorting order of Thread conversations: You can decide how Threads are arranged within the ticket by choosing between 'Date created' or 'Last updated'. You can update these settings in your profile settings. 2. Creating Private Threads: You can start a Private Thread on a Private/Public Note or customer/agent response to collaborate with different stakeholders in a chat-like interface. Private threads can be accessed by clicking on the Private Thread button on the Private or Public Note. 3. Using Discussion Threads: Discussion Threads allow you to discuss a ticket with internal or external stakeholders and tag specific agents. This can be useful when you need to collaborate closely with others on resolving a ticket. 4. Forward Threads: You can create Forward Threads whenever you need to forward a Ticket/Response/Private Note to an external stakeholder. These threads will be captured without polluting the main conversation pane and organized as Forward Threads.

Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 07:39 PM, 10th Jan Karl Nyrén There is a built in tag that is applied to tickets once a customer has responded in it. This one is called \"Customer responded\". This is great, as it visualizes it, however quite useless since we cannot filter for it. We tried filtering for it as a tag, but the tag does not exist 07:41 PM, 10th Jan Freddy You can filter tickets based on tags or other criteria using the Filter Tickets section of the Ticket view page. To achieve this, follow these steps: 1. Apply the necessary filters under the Filter Tickets section. 2. Click on the Tick mark next to the list view name (e.g., All tickets) to save these filters. 3. Give the filter a relevant heading, which you can use later. Here's a detailed article that will help you set it up. Furthermore, if you have already enabled tags for tickets and still cannot filter by the \"Customer responded\" tag, it might be a good idea to check the setup or permissions related to tag handling and custom tag filters in your admin settings.

I was wondering a little bit about the build in tag that Fresdesk has called \"Customer responded\". 07:52 PM, 10th Jan Karl Nyrén This is something that I would have created myself with your automation, but since it is already in place I did not want to re-invent the wheel 07:53 PM, 10th Jan Karl Nyrén I do however have an issue, you see in my org we handle our orders through your ticketing system 07:53 PM, 10th Jan Karl Nyrén and if a customer asks a question in an order it does get tagged with \"Customer reponded\" which is great. However, we seem unable to filter for this tag? 07:54 PM, 10th Jan Aravind That's great to know, Karl. The \"Customer responded\" tag is not a ticket tag, however, is a default system flag that is displayed in Freshdesk whenever customers respond to the ticket thread.

When exporting tickets, it is currently possible to select the option to export as \"Excel.\" However, the resulting output is provided in the .xls format, which appears to no longer be fully supported. We are experiencing difficulties opening these files, including error messages indicating that the format is unsafe or that the file might be damaged. This makes working with the exported files quite cumbersome. Would it be possible to update the standard output format from .xls to .xlsx? Is there any reason why the standard format is .xls?

Diese scheinen für Bilder in den Artikeln AWS zu nutzen. Das wird in China blockiert. Freshdesk benötigt dafür eine ICP Lizenz um Inhalte von AWS in China anzeigen zu können.

To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 07:00 PM, 14th Jan Cheryll Abisado i need agent 07:00 PM, 14th Jan Freddy I'd love to help you with that. Can you please provide more details about your concern so I can assist you better? 07:00 PM, 14th Jan Cheryll Abisado analytics data is not accurate 07:01 PM, 14th Jan Freddy Thank you for sharing that. I need to understand more to help you accurately. Could you please provide more details on what specific data or metrics you are finding inaccurate in your analytics? Are you referring to Freshdesk or Freshcaller analytics? 07:01 PM, 14th Jan Cheryll Abisado im creating analytics for tickets. I have filters applied not to include closed ticket but the data still includes closed tickets 07:02 PM, 14th Jan Freddy Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue with filters in analytics not excluding closed tickets: 1. Review Your Report Setup: - Ensure the widget settings have the correct filters. - Check if there are report-wide filters in place, as well as widget or page-level filters that could be affecting the data. 2. Validate the Data and Filters: - Make sure you have applied the filter correctly at the widget level by dragging and dropping the widget and entering the necessary filter criteria. 3. Check Historical Data: - If the data involves historical metrics, it may be counting all changes made to tickets, not just their current status. 4. Check for Data Period Conflicts: - Ensure that the page filter and widget filter align. Verify if the date range and dimensions properly reflect the needed data. 5. Analyze Unexpected Results: - If unexpected tickets, like closed ones, are showing up in analytics, review a few sample tickets using the \"Show Activities\" feature to trace their actions and understand why they might appear in the data despite applying filters. Following these steps should help troubleshoot and correct inaccuracies in your analytics data. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Freshdesk support for further assistance with your findings.

Let's chat and solve problems together! 🤝  \n*07:00 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nI need an agent.  \n*07:00 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Freddy:**  \nI'd love to help you with that. Can you please provide more details about your concern so I can assist you better?  \n*07:00 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nAnalytics data is not accurate.  \n*07:01 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Freddy:**  \nThank you for sharing that. I need to understand more to help you accurately. Could you please provide more details on what specific data or metrics you are finding inaccurate in your analytics? Are you referring to Freshdesk or Freshcaller analytics?  \n*07:01 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nI'm creating analytics for tickets. I have filters applied not to include closed tickets, but the data still includes closed tickets.  \n*07:02 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Freddy:**  \nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue with filters in analytics not excluding closed tickets:\n\n1. **Review Your Report Setup:**  \n   - Ensure the widget settings have the correct filters.  \n   - Check if there are report-wide filters in place, as well as widget or page-level filters that could be affecting the data.\n\n2. **Validate the Data and Filters:**  \n   - Make sure you have applied the filter correctly at the widget level by dragging and dropping the widget and entering the necessary filter criteria.\n\n3. **Check Historical Data:**  \n   - If the data involves historical metrics, it may be counting all changes made to tickets, not just their current status.\n\n4. **Check for Data Period Conflicts:**  \n   - Ensure that the page filter and widget filter align. Verify if the date range and dimensions properly reflect the needed data.\n\n5. **Analyze Unexpected Results:**  \n   - If unexpected tickets, like closed ones, are showing up in analytics, review a few sample tickets using the \"Show Activities\" feature to trace their actions and understand why they might appear in the data despite applying filters.\n\nFollowing these steps should help troubleshoot and correct inaccuracies in your analytics data. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Freshdesk support for further assistance with your findings.  \nRead More: Applying filters at a widget level in Analytics  \n*07:02 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Freddy:**  \nWas I helpful? Your feedback matters!  \n*07:02 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nNo.  \n*07:02 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Freddy:**  \nI'm sorry to hear that it wasn't helpful. Let me quickly connect you with a specialist.  \n*07:02 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nHi Cheryll, I hope you're doing well. I am Rajendrani from Freshdesk support, here to assist you today.  \n*07:03 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nHello.  \n*07:03 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nCould you please share the metrics and filter that you have set for the widget?  \n*07:03 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nI'm trying to create a dashboard using analytics because your dashboard cannot be customized.  \n*07:03 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nI understand that out of 5 tickets, 29714 is a closed ticket which is showing in open state.  \n*07:06 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nI filtered the tickets. The result I'm expecting should be like this.  \n*07:06 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nMy apologies, since it takes roughly half an hour to update the data from other modules to analytics. I would request you to please check the ticket count after 20 more minutes and it should be synced.  \n*07:08 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nThe data I wanted to create should be unassigned tickets. If I use the filter \"agent name is empty,\" it's not giving me any result.  \n*07:08 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nWhat?  \n*07:08 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nYou can't create a dashboard now, and you're saying analytics is not real-time?  \n*07:08 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nDashboard is important to our business.  \n*07:09 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nWe have hundreds of alert tickets coming, and we want to know which tickets are not handled according to our SLA.  \n*07:10 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nAnd we are expecting this to be in real-time!  \n*07:10 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nI asked before, I think around November, about the dashboard.  \n*07:11 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nIs there any update on the dashboard?  \n*07:11 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nI understand, please give me some time to check this for you.  \n*07:11 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nThank you for waiting. My apologies; though we can see that the feature request has been added for the customization of the Dashboard. However, we do not have an exact timeline for the implementation.  \n*07:21 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nCan you send me an email about this? Please also include that the analytics is not in real-time and it is 30 minutes behind.  \n*07:22 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nThere can be a few widgets added in the dashboard using ticket distribution that can help you see the unassigned tickets which are not resolved or closed.  \n*07:23 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nWe have a lot of tickets coming in those 30 minutes.  \n*07:23 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nThis is too bad.  \n*07:24 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nCan you also follow up with your developer team about this?  \n*07:24 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nFor SLA violations, we can add automations to send emails to your dedicated internal team members.  \n*07:25 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nYou have a dashboard, but you can't customize it. That is too bad.  \n*07:25 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nI understand, I will create a ticket on this.  \n*07:25 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nWe have email notifications already for SLA.  \n*07:26 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nWe have alerts integrated to Freshdesk, and it is very important to us.  \n*07:26 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nWe want to see unassigned tickets in real-time.  \n*07:26 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nAnd not only SLA violation.  \n*07:26 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nWe will mention the analytics syncing time and also dashboard configuration on the ticket and push it to our developers.  \n*07:27 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nI told you, we have hundreds of tickets coming in every day.  \n*07:27 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nFor unassigned tickets, we can use the dashboard just as a temporary suggestion.  \n*07:27 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nCan you send me proof that you follow up with your developer?  \n*07:27 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nSure, I am raising a ticket for this.  \n*07:28 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nI know you have a dashboard for unassigned tickets, but we wanted to filter it according to different teams.  \n*07:28 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nPlease don't forget to send the email as well.  \n*07:29 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nI have to send it to my manager.  \n*07:30 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nWe can see unassigned tickets for each group with this. Please do check if it helps in some way. I am raising a ticket, and you will receive an email in some time. Thank you for your understanding.  \n*07:30 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Cheryll Abisado:**  \nThat won't work for us.  \n*07:32 PM, 14th Jan*\n\n**Rajendrani:**  \nSure, thank you for the confirmation. You will receive an email shortly.  \n*07:33 PM, 14th Jan*",

Here’s how you can do it:  \n1. Navigate to Admin > Service Management > Helpdesk Settings > Priority Matrix.  \n2. Toggle the Enable Priority Matrix switch to ON on the Priority Matrix page.  \n3. Set the values for the Urgency and Impact fields according to your organization's requirements, defining priority levels from Low to Urgent.  \n4. Click Save to save your changes.  \n\nFrom now on, when a ticket is created or updated, Freshservice will automatically set the ticket's priority based on the values selected for Urgency and Impact. You can also configure the priority matrix to allow requesters to set the Urgency and Impact values while submitting the ticket. To do this:  \n1. Go to Admin > Service Management > Helpdesk Settings > Field Manager.  \n2. Navigate to the Ticket Fields tab.  \n3. Ensure the Requester can edit option is enabled for the 'Impact' and 'Urgency' fields.  \n4.

         "Freddy Hi Constantin Fränkel! I'm Freddy, your friendly AI agent! ? I'm here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have. To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 04:02 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel I need to chat with support immediately 04:03 PM, 16th Jan Freddy I'd love to help you with that. Can you please provide more details about your concern? That way, I can assist you better or transfer you to a support agent if needed. 04:03 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Freshdesk keeps sending the same e-mail in a loop since hours to one customer 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Freddy I'm here to help! Could you please provide more details about the issue? Specifically: 1. Is the email being triggered by a specific automation or rule in Freshdesk? 2. Have there been any recent changes to your email configurations or automations? This will help me narrow down the issue and provide a more accurate solution. 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 1. No 2. No 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Freddy Thank you for the clarifications. Based on your description, it sounds like there may be a bug or a configuration issue causing the email to loop. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try: 1. Check for duplicate automations or rules: Although you mentioned there were no changes, ensure there's no overlapping rule causing the duplication. 2. Review email logs: Check email logs within Freshdesk to identify the initiation point and frequency of the email being sent. 3. Disable and Re-enable Outgoing Emails: Temporarily disable the outgoing email configurations and then re-enable them to see if it stops the loop. 4. Inspect Email Template: Make sure the email template being used is not corrupted or has embedded links causing the loop. If the issue persists after these steps, it may require further investigation by our support team. Would you like me to transfer you to a support agent to assist you with resolving this issue? 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel No please connect me to a human agent 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Freddy Sure, let me put you in touch with one of our agents. 04:04 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Hi there, Constantin. This is Siddharth from the Freshdesk team. How are you doing today? 04:05 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Could you elaborate on the issue a bit more with the screenshot to the ticket and the looping that is happening, Constantin? 04:06 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Hello. We have an urgent problem - this already happend twice with freshdesk in the last year, but we also with support couldn't identify the reason. However, please look that you stop the message loop- Freshdesk keeps sending the same message again and again since yesterday: Ticket 36715 04:07 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:08 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Which exact message, Constantin? Could you share the screenshots of the duplicates as well? 04:08 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Look we only see the duplicates since we get via the BCC the duplicates sent 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel I cannot see it in freshdesk browser! 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel But it is being sent by freshdesk 04:09 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Could you share the Email header file of two emails from the mailbox so that I could back trace this from the logs? And the email address getting the duplicate emails is office@poolwonder.com am I right here? 04:11 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Re: Problème Nouveau message via le formulaire de contact 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Re: Problème Nouveau message via le formulaire de contact 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:12 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel 04:13 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel The bcc is office@poolwonder.com but the original adress is steve@beautyfulljeanne.com 04:13 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel We just noted that the e-mail adress of the customer is incorrect: steve@beautyfulljeanne.com , however is this freshdesk behaviour to try to resend again and again if mail is incorrect? therefore we get the bcc? 04:17 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Looks like there were multiple retries for the email, Constantin. Is there a specific reason why the Bcc is there, Constantin? You can remove the automatic Bcc if this is added by mistake, by navigating to Admin > Channel > email > Advanced email settings > Edit automatic BCC 04:18 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Yes, you are right. We have a retry policy on our end if the email sent is not delivered. 04:18 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Yes the bcc is in place so we actually know about problems like this. because otherwise i guess we would not have known that there is a problem with delivering the mail...? 04:19 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Is there a way to edit this retry policy and limit to only 3 retries for example and get notified if all 3 retries were not successful? 04:20 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth I'm afraid that the retry policy is something that is set on a product level, Constantin, and sincere apologies on the delay in response here. 04:23 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth The retries cannot be limited on an account level, so the retries would happen and eventually, we would suppress the user because of too many bounces. 04:24 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth This is the functionality of the emails sent from Freshdesk as of now. 04:25 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel and if no cc in place how would we find out about the problem then? 04:25 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth This issue is something that we have discussed internally, Constantin. We do have an \"Undelivered\" tag that we add from our end to the product's ticket page when the email is not delivered. But, this is something that is limited to the \"Freshdesk mail servers\" as of now and due to the complexities of the custom mailbox and it's attribute returns from the mailbox. 04:29 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth As of now, your account uses the Custom mailbox configuration, so the Undelivered tag will not be added, and we do have a feature request raised with our product team for the same and we are discussing this, Constantin. The issue where it becomes complex for us is the return of attributes. 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel and what do you mean by suppressing the user? Do you mean my account or the e-mail from my customer? 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth The email address of the recipient. 04:30 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel okay thank you for clarification ! 04:31 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth So say, there is a false email address whose email address is not reachable 04:31 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth We would attempt the email delivery for the address and after multiple bounces and email validation, we would suppress the user as this uses up the mailserver resources. 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth And after 7 days, the user is unsuppressed. 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel so you suppress the e-mail address of the recipient 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel not my user account of freshdesk 04:32 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth yes, not the user account on Freshdesk. It is strictly done for the end user address. 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Okay thank you ! I hope that feature request gets pushed because this is a serious bug in my opinion. 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Constantin Fränkel Have a nice day, all the best! 04:33 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth Noted the same, Constantin. And thank you so much for reaching out to us as well. Do let us know if you require any further help and we shall be happy to help with the same. 04:34 PM, 16th Jan Siddharth I shall mark this chat to the feature request and help you with the updates to the request on the ticket thread. 04:34 PM, 16th Jan Take to Team Inbox",

How are you doing today?  \n*04:05 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nCould you elaborate on the issue a bit more with the screenshot to the ticket and the looping that is happening, Constantin?  \n*04:06 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nHello. We have an urgent problem - this already happened twice with Freshdesk in the last year, but we also with support couldn't identify the reason. However, please look that you stop the message loop - Freshdesk keeps sending the same message again and again since yesterday: Ticket 36715.  \n*04:07 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nWhich exact message, Constantin? Could you share the screenshots of the duplicates as well?  \n*04:08 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nLook, we only see the duplicates since we get via the BCC the duplicates sent.  \n*04:09 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nI cannot see it in Freshdesk browser!  \n*04:09 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nBut it is being sent by Freshdesk.  \n*04:09 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nCould you share the Email header file of two emails from the mailbox so that I could backtrace this from the logs? And the email address getting the duplicate emails is office@poolwonder.com, am I right here?  \n*04:11 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nRe: Problème Nouveau message via le formulaire de contact  \n*04:12 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nThe BCC is office@poolwonder.com but the original address is steve@beautyfulljeanne.com.  \n*04:13 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nWe just noted that the email address of the customer is incorrect: steve@beautyfulljeanne.com. However, is this Freshdesk behavior to try to resend again and again if mail is incorrect? Therefore we get the BCC?  \n*04:17 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nLooks like there were multiple retries for the email, Constantin. Is there a specific reason why the BCC is there, Constantin? You can remove the automatic BCC if this is added by mistake, by navigating to Admin > Channel > Email > Advanced Email Settings > Edit Automatic BCC.  \n*04:18 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nYes, you are right. We have a retry policy on our end if the email sent is not delivered.  \n*04:18 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nYes, the BCC is in place so we actually know about problems like this. Because otherwise, I guess we would not have known that there is a problem with delivering the mail...?  \n*04:19 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nIs there a way to edit this retry policy and limit to only 3 retries, for example, and get notified if all 3 retries were not successful?  \n*04:20 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nI'm afraid that the retry policy is something that is set on a product level, Constantin, and sincere apologies for the delay in response here.  \n*04:23 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nThe retries cannot be limited on an account level, so the retries would happen and eventually, we would suppress the user because of too many bounces.  \n*04:24 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nThis is the functionality of the emails sent from Freshdesk as of now.  \n*04:25 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nAnd if no CC in place, how would we find out about the problem then?  \n*04:25 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nThis issue is something that we have discussed internally, Constantin. We do have an \"Undelivered\" tag that we add from our end to the product's ticket page when the email is not delivered. But, this is something that is limited to the \"Freshdesk mail servers\" as of now and due to the complexities of the custom mailbox and its attribute returns from the mailbox.  \n*04:29 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nAs of now, your account uses the Custom mailbox configuration, so the Undelivered tag will not be added, and we do have a feature request raised with our product team for the same and we are discussing this, Constantin. The issue where it becomes complex for us is the return of attributes.  \n*04:30 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nAnd what do you mean by suppressing the user? Do you mean my account or the email from my customer?  \n*04:30 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nThe email address of the recipient.  \n*04:30 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nOkay, thank you for clarification!  \n*04:31 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nSo say, there is a false email address whose email address is not reachable.  \n*04:31 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nWe would attempt the email delivery for the address and after multiple bounces and email validation, we would suppress the user as this uses up the mail server resources.  \n*04:32 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nAnd after 7 days, the user is unsuppressed.  \n*04:32 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nSo you suppress the email address of the recipient, not my user account of Freshdesk.  \n*04:32 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nYes, not the user account on Freshdesk. It is strictly done for the end-user address.  \n*04:33 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nOkay, thank you! I hope that feature request gets pushed because this is a serious bug in my opinion.  \n*04:33 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Constantin Fränkel:**  \nHave a nice day, all the best!  \n*04:33 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nNoted the same, Constantin. And thank you so much for reaching out to us as well. Do let us know if you require any further help and we shall be happy to help with the same.  \n*04:34 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Siddharth:**  \nI shall mark this chat to the feature request and help you with the updates to the request on the ticket thread.  \n*04:34 PM, 16th Jan*  \n\n**Take to Team Inbox**",

This app allows you to prevent agents from editing the groups while keeping the other required fields visible and functional.

The column still shows up even when the field is hidden 06:51 PM, 16th Jan Freddy It seems there is currently an identified issue in Freshdesk where attempting to delete the group name in the table view from the tickets list view causes it to reappear. The developers are aware of this bug and are working on a fix. As of now, there isn't a method to specifically remove just the \"Group\" column without also removing the \"Agent\" column due to this bug.

How can I assist you today? 03:10 PM, 17th Jan BoomTech Support Support I use AI bot I want to ask user for email before conversioation and need it to be required is it possible? 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Could you please provide more details about the AI bot or the system you are referring to? This will help me assist you better. For instance, is it a chatbot on a specific platform or part of a particular software or service? 03:15 PM, 17th Jan BoomTech Support Support I mena new AI Agent 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Apologies! I am trained to answer in English, Hindi, Spanish, Dutch, Spanish (Latin America), Portuguese (BR), Swedish, German and French. 03:15 PM, 17th Jan Freddy Yes, it is possible to ask users for their email before starting a conversation with an AI agent and make it required. You can configure your bot conversation settings to include mandatory questions such as capturing the user's email. Here are the steps to do that: 1. Set Up Bot Questions: - Go to Admin > Bots and use the Enabled/Disabled toggle to turn on the bot interaction. - Edit the default questions or add custom questions to capture user information before proceeding with the conversation. By default, the bot questions include capturing the Email, Name, and Phone number. You can configure these questions to validate responses to ensure they meet required formats (e.g., a valid email format). 2. Customization: - You can add custom questions by clicking on Add Custom Question and entering the required details such as the label, text, and response type. You can also specify validation messages if the user provides an invalid response. 3. Validation: - Configure negative validation responses for the questions. For example, if the user's reply to the Email ID question is invalid, you can prompt them with a message like \"Oops..Please enter a valid email ID\". 4. Workflow Configuration: - The Hallway Lead Bot allows you to collect user information such as name, email, and phone, validate responses with follow-up questions, and set appropriate messages if responses are invalid. By ensuring these configurations, the bot will prompt and validate the required user information, like an email ID, before proceeding with any conversation. For more information and detailed steps, you can refer to sources about setting up and customizing bot interactions and workflows.

For further customizing the ticket view options, you can use the options available for viewing tickets on the customer portal by setting up ticket fields and filtering options: - Allow Users to Filter Tickets: - Add ticket fields as filters on the customer portal. Only Dropdowns and Dependent ticket fields can be added as filter options.

However, I've discovered that Freshdesk doesn't currently offer a tag trigger on Zapier. Zapier has advised that this functionality lies with Freshdesk's developers. I've noticed that Zendesk provides this tag trigger and other advanced triggers, which leads me to question why Freshdesk hasn't implemented similar features.

         "My name is Anderson, and I’m with AirPro Diagnostics in Florida. We use Freshdesk as our ticketing system, and I wanted to reach out regarding user permissions. Would it be possible to grant external users the ability to \"edit and search\" the tickets they have submitted? This feature would greatly enhance their workflow and productivity. Since I'm part of the IT team, I receive incoming tickets, and I’ve noticed a recurring issue. For example, if our QC team submits a ticket for a defective laptop that needs replacement, but later realizes they forgot to mention a cracked screen, they have no option to update the existing ticket. Instead, they create a \"new ticket\", which can lead to clutter and inefficiencies. Non Freshdesk Agent users (For Ex:, HR department, QC, etc ) submit dozens of tickets daily, or even hundreds per month, and the inability to modify their submissions often leads to unnecessary duplicate tickets. Since they are not Freshdesk Agents, they currently lack permissions to \"edit and search\" their own tickets. Would you be able to suggest the best approach to allow Non-Agents (external users) to edit and search their previously submitted tickets without granting them full Agent permissions? Ideally, we’d like them to be able to update their own tickets without gaining broader system access. I’d appreciate any insights or recommendations you might have on this. Looking forward to your response! Best regards, Anderson AirPro Diagnostics",

When users search for a term (e.g., \"dataset\"), the results currently display only the folder name containing the relevant articles. They would like the full path to be displayed for better clarity and organization. Example Scenario: If the folder hierarchy is: Dataset -> Create Dataset -> View Dataset -> Update When searching for \"dataset,\" the results should display the full path (e.g., \"Dataset -> Create\") instead of just \"Dataset.\" The customer highlighted that this feature would significantly improve usability, especially when multiple folders share the same or similar names. They also asked if this functionality could be implemented through theme customizations, but it was clarified that such changes would require their developer's assistance. Thank you!",

While setting up the Offboarding Form, when I select Assets (to be collected from the relieving employee), the resulting form has the option for Transfer Ownership enabled by default. I can't remove that as an option from the dropdown. We collect and inspect each piece of equipment, thus I would like to remove that option from the dropdown form.

Hope you are safe and well! 12:02 PM, 21st Jan Swaran How may I assist you today? 12:02 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng hi 12:02 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng 12:02 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng you see this ticket 12:02 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng when we reply this email, one of the recipiants is a email group, it will triger a refuse from the email group due to some certain individual's email is invalid 12:04 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng 12:04 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng this is very annoying 12:04 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng I sofly deleted this contact, but it still appears in every ticket as a third party reply 12:05 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng how can I delete such replies automatically? 12:05 PM, 21st Jan Swaran Thank you for your clear explanation of the query. As much as I can help you here, I'm afraid Freshdesk currently does not support the feature to delete Customer Replies on the ticket automatically / manually. Only the agent replies can be deleted. However I agree that the automated response you receive in your use case can be annoying. I would like to propose a workaround for this 12:06 PM, 21st Jan Swaran You can split the specific note on the ticket so it gets created as a new ticket. splitting the response will automatically remove the note from this ticket and will get populated as a new ticket. You can Spam/Delete the new ticket and refresh the old ticket page so that the response is removed from the ticket 12:08 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng can this action be automatically done with automations or other function? 12:08 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng or can I set up somewhere to make this certain contact's email create a new ticket rather than involved in the original ticket? 12:09 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng for other tickets I still need the replied be thread in the same ticket 12:10 PM, 21st Jan Swaran Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to set up splitting of a ticket via automation. Hence the workaround was suggested. Regarding setting up a rule to have this certain contact's email come as a new ticket is also not possible. However, I personally completely understand your requirement of being able to delete the customer responses. I will have your valuable feedback passed in to our product team so they can possibly check the feasibility of having this added as a feature enhancement. 12:10 PM, 21st Jan Swaran The only way currently to have the note not displayed on the ticket is splitting the note manually. 12:11 PM, 21st Jan Swaran You will hear from us to \"amphee.meng@pkfare.com\" shortly where I will have a ticket created and raise the feature request on our behalf. I greatly appreciate your understanding on this case. 12:12 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng what if I set up in our email server that delete the email automatically when receive it, could it still be received by freshdesk? 12:13 PM, 21st Jan Swaran Only the emails receiving to your inbox will be captured by Freshdesk 12:13 PM, 21st Jan Swaran In case the emails receiving your inbox are automatically deleted or moved to a different folder, Freshdesk will not pull those emails 12:13 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng you mean as long as the email received, it will be captured in freshdesk? 12:13 PM, 21st Jan Swaran If you set up the rule on the mail server, the emails will not be reaching your inbox as they will be deleted or moved to a different folder 12:14 PM, 21st Jan Swaran The mail server will first validate the rules you have set up before pushing the email to your inbox 12:15 PM, 21st Jan Swaran Hence Freshdesk will not pull those emails resulting in the emails not coming in to Freshdesk, so yes. This will work 12:15 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng I will try and see if it's work 12:15 PM, 21st Jan amphee meng meng but anyway please help me feedback this to product team 12:15 PM, 21st Jan Swaran Definitely, I will have this conversation converted into a ticket.

You can Spam/Delete the new ticket and refresh the old ticket page so that the response is removed from the ticket.  \n**12:08 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Amphee Meng Meng:**  \nCan this action be automatically done with automations or other functions?  \n**12:08 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Amphee Meng Meng:**  \nOr can I set up somewhere to make this certain contact's email create a new ticket rather than be involved in the original ticket?  \n**12:09 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Amphee Meng Meng:**  \nFor other tickets, I still need the replies to be threaded in the same ticket.  \n**12:10 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Swaran:**  \nUnfortunately, it is not currently possible to set up splitting of a ticket via automation. Hence the workaround was suggested. Regarding setting up a rule to have this certain contact's email come as a new ticket is also not possible. However, I personally completely understand your requirement of being able to delete the customer responses. I will have your valuable feedback passed on to our product team so they can possibly check the feasibility of having this added as a feature enhancement.  \n**12:10 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Swaran:**  \nThe only way currently to have the note not displayed on the ticket is by splitting the note manually.  \n**12:11 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Swaran:**  \nYou will hear from us at \"amphee.meng@pkfare.com\" shortly where I will have a ticket created and raise the feature request on our behalf. I greatly appreciate your understanding on this case.  \n**12:12 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Amphee Meng Meng:**  \nWhat if I set up in our email server that deletes the email automatically when received, could it still be received by Freshdesk?  \n**12:13 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Swaran:**  \nOnly the emails receiving to your inbox will be captured by Freshdesk.  \n**12:13 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Swaran:**  \nIn case the emails receiving your inbox are automatically deleted or moved to a different folder, Freshdesk will not pull those emails.  \n**12:13 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Amphee Meng Meng:**  \nYou mean as long as the email is received, it will be captured in Freshdesk?  \n**12:13 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Swaran:**  \nIf you set up the rule on the mail server, the emails will not be reaching your inbox as they will be deleted or moved to a different folder.  \n**12:14 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Swaran:**  \nThe mail server will first validate the rules you have set up before pushing the email to your inbox.  \n**12:15 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Swaran:**  \nHence Freshdesk will not pull those emails resulting in the emails not coming into Freshdesk, so yes. This will work.  \n**12:15 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Amphee Meng Meng:**  \nI will try and see if it works.  \n**12:15 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Amphee Meng Meng:**  \nBut anyway, please help me feedback this to the product team.  \n**12:15 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Swaran:**  \nDefinitely, I will have this conversation converted into a ticket. I appreciate your cooperation throughout this case.  \n**12:16 PM, 21st Jan**  \n\n**Take to Team Inbox**",

Your feedback matters! 02:33 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service Does exporting take a long time? 02:36 PM, 22nd Jan Freddy The time it takes to export data from Freshdesk depends on the amount of data being exported. Generally, smaller sets of data can be exported relatively quickly, usually within a few minutes. However, larger datasets might take longer and you will receive the exported data via email once the process is completed. If you have a significant amount of data to export, it is advisable to use scheduled exports to manage the process more efficiently. 02:36 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service 为什么只有import 没有export 02:39 PM, 22nd Jan Freddy 在 Freshdesk 中，导入和导出数据是两项不同的功能。导出电子邮件和客户信息是可以实现的，可能你没有找到相关的导出选项。以下是导出功能的步骤： 1. 直接导出数据： - 以管理员或主管身份登录你的支持门户。 - 导航到帮助台中的“联系人”标签。 - 点击 导出 并选择要导出的字段（包括任何自定义字段）。 - 点击 导出 按钮。你将通过电子邮件接收所选数据的 CSV 文件。 2. 计划导出数据： - 转到 Analytics > 点击 设置 图标 > 选择 Data Exports。 - 点击 Create New Export。 - 提供名称、描述并选择模块（例如，工单、工时表、调查）。 - 选择你希望收到导出的时间（每日、每周或每月），并设置所需时间。 - 设置任何所需的过滤器，并选择要包含在 CSV 文件中的工单字段和/或标记字段。 - 如果你希望通过 API 接收导出文件，请将 URL 复制并粘贴到你的商业智能工具中。 详细的导出说明和更多选项可以帮助你进一步了解和使用。你可以查看管理员设置和分析部分来找到导出的选项。如果你有其他问题，请告诉我！ 02:39 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service 没有export选项 02:40 PM, 22nd Jan Freddy 了解了，请问您可以具体说明在哪个部分没有找到导出的选项吗？是联系人、工单，还是其他部分？您也可以告诉我您现在看到的界面，以便我更好地指导您找到导出选项。 02:40 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service 在联系人界面没有找到export选项 02:41 PM, 22nd Jan Freddy 如果在联系人的界面没有找到导出的选项，这里有一些可能的解决方法： 1. 确认权限：确保你登录的是管理员或符合权限的账号，因为导出数据的选项仅对具有适当权限的用户可用。 2. 界面位置： - 在联系人的界面，通常导出选项会在右上角的三个点的菜单中（即更多选项，通常是一个垂直的省略号图标）。 - 点击该选项，应该能看到导出数据的选项。 3. 使用报告功能： - 如果仍然无法找到导出选项，可以使用“报告”功能，生成一个联系人报告，然后从报告中导出数据。 你可以尝试在“管理员设置”或“报告与分析”中查找导出选项。如果您仍然无法找到，请提供更多关于您所看到的界面的具体信息，我会尽力帮助您找到导出功能。 02:41 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service 人工 02:43 PM, 22nd Jan Freddy Sure, let me put you in touch with one of our agents. 02:43 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj Hi Team 02:43 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj Please allow me a moment to go through the chat 02:43 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj We understand you're unable to see export button in Contacts tab 02:44 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj correct me if I'm wrong 02:44 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service Why is there only import but no export? 02:45 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service I want to export emails from some contacts 02:45 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj Can you share a screenshot of the page you see? 02:46 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service 02:47 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj Export option would not be available in an unsaved view.

It is a feature request that is in place. Export of all contacts is currently available. Hence, as a workaround recommend you export all the contacts & filter them out of the export data 02:54 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj Let me create a ticket, so we can track this feature request & let you know in the future once the feature to export filtered set of contact data is made available.

Your feedback matters! 02:33 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service Does exporting take a long time? 02:36 PM, 22nd Jan Freddy The time it takes to export data from Freshdesk depends on the amount of data being exported. Generally, smaller sets of data can be exported relatively quickly, usually within a few minutes. However, larger datasets might take longer and you will receive the exported data via email once the process is completed. If you have a significant amount of data to export, it is advisable to use scheduled exports to manage the process more efficiently. 02:36 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service 为什么只有import 没有export 02:39 PM, 22nd Jan Freddy 在 Freshdesk 中，导入和导出数据是两项不同的功能。导出电子邮件和客户信息是可以实现的，可能你没有找到相关的导出选项。以下是导出功能的步骤： 1. 直接导出数据： - 以管理员或主管身份登录你的支持门户。 - 导航到帮助台中的“联系人”标签。 - 点击 导出 并选择要导出的字段（包括任何自定义字段）。 - 点击 导出 按钮。你将通过电子邮件接收所选数据的 CSV 文件。 2. 计划导出数据： - 转到 Analytics > 点击 设置 图标 > 选择 Data Exports。 - 点击 Create New Export。 - 提供名称、描述并选择模块（例如，工单、工时表、调查）。 - 选择你希望收到导出的时间（每日、每周或每月），并设置所需时间。 - 设置任何所需的过滤器，并选择要包含在 CSV 文件中的工单字段和/或标记字段。 - 如果你希望通过 API 接收导出文件，请将 URL 复制并粘贴到你的商业智能工具中。 详细的导出说明和更多选项可以帮助你进一步了解和使用。你可以查看管理员设置和分析部分来找到导出的选项。如果你有其他问题，请告诉我！ 02:39 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service 没有export选项 02:40 PM, 22nd Jan Freddy 了解了，请问您可以具体说明在哪个部分没有找到导出的选项吗？是联系人、工单，还是其他部分？您也可以告诉我您现在看到的界面，以便我更好地指导您找到导出选项。 02:40 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service 在联系人界面没有找到export选项 02:41 PM, 22nd Jan Freddy 如果在联系人的界面没有找到导出的选项，这里有一些可能的解决方法： 1. 确认权限：确保你登录的是管理员或符合权限的账号，因为导出数据的选项仅对具有适当权限的用户可用。 2. 界面位置： - 在联系人的界面，通常导出选项会在右上角的三个点的菜单中（即更多选项，通常是一个垂直的省略号图标）。 - 点击该选项，应该能看到导出数据的选项。 3. 使用报告功能： - 如果仍然无法找到导出选项，可以使用“报告”功能，生成一个联系人报告，然后从报告中导出数据。 你可以尝试在“管理员设置”或“报告与分析”中查找导出选项。如果您仍然无法找到，请提供更多关于您所看到的界面的具体信息，我会尽力帮助您找到导出功能。 02:41 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service 人工 02:43 PM, 22nd Jan Freddy Sure, let me put you in touch with one of our agents. 02:43 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj Hi Team 02:43 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj Please allow me a moment to go through the chat 02:43 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj We understand you're unable to see export button in Contacts tab 02:44 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj correct me if I'm wrong 02:44 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service Why is there only import but no export? 02:45 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service I want to export emails from some contacts 02:45 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj Can you share a screenshot of the page you see? 02:46 PM, 22nd Jan Customer Service 02:47 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj Export option would not be available in an unsaved view.

It is a feature request that is in place. Export of all contacts is currently available. Hence, as a workaround recommend you export all the contacts & filter them out of the export data 02:54 PM, 22nd Jan Manoj Let me create a ticket, so we can track this feature request & let you know in the future once the feature to export filtered set of contact data is made available.

         "Hi Team, Account id - 2863973 url - vanmosselbelgie.freshdesk.com 1.Answering tickets is not very efficient. Many tickets are forwarded, from another department or intermediary. Because of this, in theory you should use the forward button to give an answer to the customer or driver. This makes the communication private, which is not the intention (threads). You can still do a reply, but it is very cumbersome. By clicking on the 3 dots, you can change the settings, and therefore also the addressee. In addition, you must also remember to add and send any attachments. This is possible with a forward, but not with a reply. 2.It is not possible to drag a ticket to a folder or to another software, such as Carwise, Outlook or almost any other web-based tool.This would make it much more efficient, also in light of the first point. 3.After you add an attachment in your email processing, you cannot open it to verify that it is the correct attachment (for double-checking). This is an internal guideline to always check the attachment before sending, in the context of the GDPR legislation. We do not want to transfer personal data from one customer to another customer by mistake. 4.Outlook calendar integration is not possible in Freshdesk .

If I add date created, it keeps it in the filter, but won't show it on the report - perhaps that's the customization problem again, but at least it gives me the right data - I can work with that for now, thanks.  \n*09:52 PM, 22nd Jan*\n\n**Adhithyan:**  \nSure, Bruce...  \n*09:52 PM, 22nd Jan*\n\n**Adhithyan:**  \nAs you mentioned, due to plan restriction, the filters will not be saved...  \n*09:52 PM, 22nd Jan*\n\n**Adhithyan:**  \nI will have a ticket created anyways and keep it as a feature request.... Also, will inform our team so that in case you are interested in exploring the pro plan, you can try it out as well...  \n*09:53 PM, 22nd Jan*\n\n**Bruce Dawson:**  \nOk, thanks a lot, bye.  \n*09:53 PM, 22nd Jan*\n\n**Adhithyan:**  \nSure, Bruce... Thank you for your time and Have a Great Day!  \n*09:53 PM, 22nd Jan*",

To help provide the best possible support, please include as much detail and context as you can about your query. Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 08:52 PM, 24th Jan Franck Coppola Coppola My Kanban board does not display all open tickets. Count open tickets : 78 but only 30 displayed in Kanban. 08:53 PM, 24th Jan Freddy It appears you are experiencing an issue where your Kanban board is displaying only 30 out of 78 open tickets. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue: 1. Check Ticket Filters: Ensure there are no filters applied on the Kanban board that might be restricting the display to only 30 tickets. Filters can sometimes limit the visible tickets based on certain criteria. 2. Adjust Ticket Views: Verify if the Kanban board view settings allow for viewing more than 30 tickets. Adjust the settings to increase the number of visible tickets per page to 50 or 100 if possible. 3. Session Settings: Keep in mind that the selection of tickets per page (30, 50, or 100) is local to an agent and reset per session. Make sure the settings persist across sessions by confirming the settings before applying. 4. Layout and Sorting: Switch between Card View and Table View layouts, as different layouts may display different numbers of tickets. Check with your admin if specific layouts are enforced by default settings. If these steps do not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to customer support for further assistance.

         "**Subject:** Queue - First Come First Serve - Concept\n\n**Description:** \n\nHi,\n\nI was wondering if Freshdesk has the capability where specific types of requests have their own queue and requests are handled on a first come, first serve basis. Customers can see where they are in line. For example:\n\n- Someone from Company ABC submits a ticket on January 22 requesting a custom report to be developed for them. When we change the status to \"Open,\" they will be in Position 1.\n\n- Someone from Company LMN submits a ticket on January 22 requesting a custom report to be developed for them. The requirements are not clear, so the ticket is not changed to \"Open\" status. They are not added to the queue.\n\n- Someone from Company XYZ submits a ticket on January 24 requesting a custom report to be developed for them. When we change the status to \"Open,\" they will be in Position 2.\n\n- Now Company LMN has refined their requirements and updated the ticket. We have changed the status to \"Open,\" and they will be in Position 3.\n\n- We have completed Company ABC's request. Now Company XYZ gets Position 1, and Company LMN gets bumped to Position 2.\n\nRegards,  \nSunny Grewal",

Freshchat allows you to add labels to conversations which can be used to categorize them based on the type of query. You can then filter these conversations to create custom views or metrics. To categorize conversations using labels, you can add them under Settings → Labels → Add Label on your Freshchat dashboard. Additionally, Freshchat also supports creating custom conversation views based on various filters including these labels. Furthermore, you can track the volume of tickets associated with different labels to analyze the pattern and distribution of incoming requests. If you want to view or filter conversations in real-time, you can do so from the Conversations logs page where you can apply filters such as time, conversation status, or labels to customize your list.

Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 12:14 AM, 28th Jan Mark Wright would like child ticket to populate after HR completes background check 12:14 AM, 28th Jan Freddy To automatically create a child ticket after HR completes the background check, you would set up an automation using the Workflow Automator. Here are the steps to create the workflow: 1. Navigate to Admin -> Workflow Automator -> New Automator -> Ticket. 2. Drag and drop the event node and select 'Service Request is Updated' when the Background Check is marked as complete. 3. Add a condition node to specify other necessary conditions. 4. Finally, drag and drop the action node and select 'Create Child Ticket' with the appropriate API call to create the child ticket. This workflow will ensure that a child ticket is automatically created when the initial background check is completed by the HR team.

Let's chat and solve problems together! ? 12:14 AM, 28th Jan Mark Wright would like child ticket to populate after HR completes background check 12:14 AM, 28th Jan Freddy To automatically create a child ticket after HR completes the background check, you would set up an automation using the Workflow Automator. Here are the steps to create the workflow: 1. Navigate to Admin -> Workflow Automator -> New Automator -> Ticket. 2. Drag and drop the event node and select 'Service Request is Updated' when the Background Check is marked as complete. 3. Add a condition node to specify other necessary conditions. 4. Finally, drag and drop the action node and select 'Create Child Ticket' with the appropriate API call to create the child ticket. This workflow will ensure that a child ticket is automatically created when the initial background check is completed by the HR team.

         "Jesse Davis Another question, for ticket automation, when we use the \"Hours since [status]\" condition, is it possible to have that be based on business hours in the group? 05:40 AM, 28th Jan Freddy The automation rules for hourly triggers in Freshdesk execute based on calendar hours, not business hours. This means the 'Hours since [status]' condition cannot be configured to be based on business hours in the group. 05:40 AM, 28th Jan Jesse Davis I need to be able to set a status that pauses the SLA timer but only for a set number of days within the group's business hours. Once the number of days elapse, I need to resume SLA timer. Is this possible? 05:42 AM, 28th Jan Freddy In Freshdesk, you can manage SLA timers effectively by using the 'Pending' status to pause the SLA timer when waiting for a customer or other condition. Here’s how you can set it up for a specific number of days within the group's business hours and then resume: 1. Set the SLA policy: Go to Admin > Workflows > SLA Policies. Define the business hours specific to the group. 2. Create a new automation rule: Navigate to Admin > Workflows > Automations and choose to create a new rule with an hourly trigger. 3. Configure the trigger condition: Set the condition based on the ticket properties, for instance, 'Hours since pending' to specify the number of days within the business hours. 4. Pause the SLA timer: When the status is 'Pending,' the SLA timer is paused. Set an action to automatically change the status back after the specified number of days, resuming the SLA timer. This approach helps you control and manage the SLA based on business hours. However, the SLA clock in Freshdesk runs based on calendar hours not just business hours, ensure you carefully manage the status changes to align with your SLA policies. 05:43 AM, 28th Jan Jesse Davis I'd like to speak with an agent about this please 05:44 AM, 28th Jan Freddy Sure, let me put you in touch with one of our agents. 05:44 AM, 28th Jan Prateek Hey Jesse!

However, we need the number of hours elapsed to only be counted within the group's business hours 05:52 AM, 28th Jan Vinu I am afraid, the time trigger automation only counts hours elapsed in calendar hours.

However, for the Repair_Status field, there is no dropdown available in list view.  \n**10:47 PM, 28th Jan**  \n\n**Aditya:**  \nI have seen the history of the chat and can you please confirm if Repair_Status is the custom field?  \n**10:47 PM, 28th Jan**  \n\n**Jon England:**  \nI believe it is a custom field.  \n**10:48 PM, 28th Jan**  \n\n**Jon England:**  \nIs custom field the same as 'not default'?  \n**10:48 PM, 28th Jan**  \n\n**Aditya:**  \nCould you please share the screenshot where you want to update the field with us?

Kindly allow me a few minutes, I am checking the details at my end.  \n**10:57 PM, 28th Jan**  \n\n**Jon England:**  \nThank you.  \n**10:57 PM, 28th Jan**  \n\n**Aditya:**  \nThanks for your patience. Currently, we do have only four default fields that can be updated i.e., status, agents, priority, and group, and currently, we do not have the feature to update other fields via list table/card view. However, I have taken your feedback and will pass it on to the product team.  \n**11:01 PM, 28th Jan**  \n\n**Jon England:**  \nOk - thanks for feeding that back. Much appreciated.  \n**11:03 PM, 28th Jan**  \n\n**Aditya:**  \nThanks for your time on the chat. Have a great day!  \n**11:03 PM, 28th Jan**  \n\n**Take to Team Inbox**",

         "Hi Harsha, Thank you for the excellent support. I have a question regarding service items and changing the entered values after the item request form has been submitted. To give you some context, I'm working on the Employee Onboarding module for our company, and our HR accidentally entered the new hire's name incorrectly, she put in Lara when it should have been Laura: Can the 'employee information' be changed through the ticket or would HR need to resubmit another onboarding request with the correct spelling to fix the error? I'm hoping that this data can be updated without having to resubmit another service item/onboarding request.

Let's chat and solve problems together! 🤝  \n*02:05 AM, 30th Jan*\n\n**Paul Mendoza:**  \nHi there, how can I activate a \"send\" button in the chat?  \n*02:05 AM, 30th Jan*\n\n**Freddy:**  \nTo activate the \"send\" button in the chat, you need to ensure the setup is properly configured. You can utilize the widget actions provided, specifically the options to open the chat widget, minimize, and show messages proactively. Here are the action steps you can take:\n\n1. **Auto open chat widget:** This opens the chat widget even without the customer clicking on it, which could indirectly ensure the \"send\" button is visible.\n2. **Configure your chat widget basic settings:** Ensure that the necessary settings such as enabling the chat widget by default, configuring the JavaScript functions to initialize and show the widget are properly set up.\n3. **Specify action triggers:** Set up the necessary triggers or events that would open the chat widget and expose the \"send\" button when a customer interacts with the bot.\n\nIf you need more detailed steps for specific settings or actions, please let me know!  \nRead More: [Configuring Actions in the Bot Builder](#)  \n*02:05 AM, 30th Jan*\n\n**Freddy:**  \nWas this helpful?

Let me quickly connect you with a specialist. 02:58 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh Hello Karen, 02:58 AM, 04th Feb Karen Johnson hello I was wondering if i can get some help on two things 02:58 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh Sure! 02:59 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh Do let me know! 02:59 AM, 04th Feb Karen Johnson 1. my company would like to see a report that shows when a ticket was assigned to an agent and when their first private note was added 03:00 AM, 04th Feb Karen Johnson We are trying to track \"time to touch\" the ticket. We do not utilize first response because we do not talk to patients through desk. 03:01 AM, 04th Feb Karen Johnson We only use it as our tasking system and we are trying to track how long it takes and agent to start working on a ticket from time of assignment 03:01 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh Sure, let me check this! 03:02 AM, 04th Feb Karen Johnson Thank you 03:02 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh Thank you for your patience 03:08 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh We tested this on our end. 03:08 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh We see that for first assigned time, following metric can be used: 03:09 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh However, we do not have the metric to track the first Private Note Time. 03:09 AM, 04th Feb Karen Johnson hmmm ok 03:09 AM, 04th Feb Karen Johnson I guess its harder for us since we don't utilize desk for patient outreach because the first response sla would only benefit When thats used 03:11 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh We might be able to achieve this via some workaround. 03:12 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh however, that would require some digging in 03:12 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh For that, may I go ahead and create a support ticket? 03:13 AM, 04th Feb Karen Johnson yes thats fine. and i have one more question. 03:13 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh Sure, let me know! 03:13 AM, 04th Feb Karen Johnson About a year ago we where able to audit tickets through fresh desk and our agents could view the score in tickets. I have tried to locate how to do that again as we would like to begin quality checks on tickets and have that visible. We did not use a 3rd party app we did it directly through fresh desk. Can you tel me hoe i find this and set it back up or if there is another option in the system do quality assurance checks on tickets? 03:18 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh Thank you for the details, 03:20 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh Agent Performance Report can be used to have these details. 03:20 AM, 04th Feb Hitesh An Agent Performance Report in Freshdesk is a report that tracks an agent's efficiency and productivity based on key metrics like ticket resolution time, response time, SLA compliance, and customer satisfaction.

I just purchased a single Freddy AI license to test out, and I'm not quite sure how to assign it to myself. Solution articles say I need to assign the role to myself, but the permissions won't let me modify my own roles. 07:17 AM, 04th Feb Prasanth Please note that you don't need to assign the role to yourself; it is simply a role that needs to be assigned to the profile. 07:18 AM, 04th Feb Prasanth Yes, that's correct. Please ask the other agent with admin access to assign this role to your profile in order to use the Freddy AI feature. - Shaun 07:19 AM, 04th Feb Shaun Heckman Man, that's annoying. I'm the one who created the overall Freshservice account and I can't assign myself a tool to test out. Meanwhile, it's later at night, and I wanted to use this to build some reports, and no other agents are online right now. 07:20 AM, 04th Feb Prasanth Shaun, I understand your concern but this is due to security reasons, and you will need to ask the other agent to assign the role to your profile. 07:21 AM, 04th Feb Prasanth However, I will certainly relay this feedback to my product team to assess the feasibility of implementing this feature as per your requirements to assign roles to self. 07:22 AM, 04th Feb Prasanth I trust I have clarified your inquiry. 07:23 AM, 04th Feb Prasanth If you need further assistance please revert back to us 07:23 AM, 04th Feb Prasanth Thanks for reaching out to FreshService Support.
